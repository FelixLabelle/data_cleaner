       "    'body': 'Demonstrators wearing the yellow, high-visibility vests that symbolise their movement threw projectiles at police preventing them from moving along the famed shopping avenue, which was decked out in twinkling Christmas lights.\\n\\nThey also built barricades in some spots, and tore down traffic lights and street signs, creating riotous scenes reminiscent of France\\'s 1968 civil unrest, or street insurrections in the mid-19th century immortalised in paintings and movies.\\n\\nPolice arrested 130 people, 69 of those in Paris, and 24 people were injured, five of them police officers including one who suffered burns to his groin, the city police department and Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said.\\n\\nElsewhere, protesters took over highway toll booths to let traffic pass for free, or held go-slow vehicle processions, underlining one of their core complaints of escalating taxes on car fuel, especially diesel.\\n\\nMacron, targeted by protesters\\' calls that he resign, took to Twitter to thank police.\\n\\n\"Shame\" on those who assaulted or intimidated citizens, journalists and politicians, Macron said. \"There is no place for violence in the (French) Republic.\"\\n\\nCalm returned to the streets of the capital after midnight on Saturday, with the Champs-Elysees reopening to traffic.\\n\\nThe clean-up operation also got under way as garbage trucks were deployed and workers removed barricades along the famous avenue.\\n\\nSmaller than a week ago\\n\\nThe violence was on a smaller scale than a week ago when the \"yellow vest\" movement staged its first nationwide protest.\\n\\n\"We\\'re not here to beat up cops. We came because we want the government to hear us,\" said one protest spokeswoman, Laetitia Dewalle, 37, adding that the largely spontaneous movement denounced \"violence by pseudo-protesters\" on the fringes.\\n\\n\"We have just demonstrated peacefully, and we were teargassed,\" said Christophe, 49, who travelled from the Isere region in eastern France with his wife to protest in the capital.\\n\\nThe interior ministry counted 106,000 protesters across France on Saturday, with 8,000 in Paris, of whom around 5,000 were on the Champs-Elysees.\\n\\nThat was far less than the national tally of 282,000 in the November 17 protests.\\n\\nCastaner said after the tumult died down that damage on the Champs-Elysees was \"small\".\\n\\nThe French government cast blame for the unruly protests on far-right politician Marine Le Pen, claiming she egged them on.\\n\\nBut Le Pen rejected that accusation saying she had \"never called for any violence whatsoever\" and in turn accused the government of \"organising the tension\" and seeking to make her a scapegoat.\\n\\nMeanwhile, opposition parties on both the right and left accused the government of trying to reduce the protests to just the sporadic scenes of violence, and turning a deaf ear to the demonstrators\\' grievances.\\n\\nJean-Luc Melenchon, leader of the radical left France Unbowed party who attended a separate march Saturday protesting violence against women, tweeted that the action on the streets was \"a mass protest of the people\" which signalled \"the end for Castaner\".\\n\\nRural frustrations\\n\\nA week ago, two people died and over 750 people, including 136 police officers, were injured in sometimes violent demonstrations that have shone a light on frustrations in many rural areas and small towns of France.\\n\\nThe \"yellow vests\" hail overwhelmingly from non-urban areas of France. They feel overlooked and penalised by policies they see as being pushed through by elitist politicians in Paris.\\n\\nFormer investment banker Macron was elected on a pledge to put more money in workers\\' pockets. But the effects of his pro-business reforms on unemployment and purchasing power have been limited so far.\\n\\nMany of the often low-income \"yellow vest\" protesters are particularly incensed at his decision to hike anti-pollution taxes on diesel, while scrapping a wealth tax on the rich.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not just fighting against the price of fuel. It\\'s about tax, what we pay,\" protester Catherine Marguier told AFP near the village of La Gravelle in northwest France.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in a separate protest in the southern city of Marseille, police fired teargas at bottle-throwing demonstrators upset by the \"gentrification\" renovation work on the town\\'s biggest square. Around 1,200 demonstrators took part and two were arrested.\\n\\n\\'Gap between rich and poor\\'\\n\\nRevolts against taxes have been a feature of French public life for centuries. Citizens still pay some of the highest in Europe as a percentage of GDP, and fuel-price protests are a common modern occurrence.\\n\\nPrevious rounds pitting the government against drivers took place in 1995, 2000, 2004, and 2008, often when tax increases coincided with high oil prices -- as they have this year.\\n\\nA poll by the Odoxa research group for Le Figaro newspaper this week found that 77 percent of respondents described it as \"justified\".',\n",

       "    'title': \"Riots on Champs-Élysées: Why violence has become 'legitimate' for some Yellow Vests\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Paris on Saturday saw a second ultra-violent Yellow Vest protest. Although the rioting has been blamed on extreme elements who have infiltrated the movement, some Yellow Vests have now accepted it as legitimate to achieve their goals, an expert says.\\n\\nFor most, the March 16 violence in Paris dropped like a bomb shell: After weeks of weaker participation and the once-a-week rallies being contained by security forces without any major incidents, France\\'s Yellow Vest movement was being described as running out of steam. \"Act XVIII\" of the protests, however, showed that the Yellow Vests had not given up, and resulted in France\\'s emblematic Champs-Élysées boulevard being left in a pile of broken glass and flames.\\n\\nThe government has attributed the violence to extreme elements - so-called casseurs - who have infiltrated the movement from both the left and the right side of the political spectrum.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s actions are not the work of protesters, but of looters, arsonists and criminals. No cause justifies this violence,\" Prime Minister Édouard Philippe tweeted after visiting the scene of the destruction.\\n\\nWhile some Yellow Vests continue to fully distance themselves from the violence, others now appear willing to let the ransacking slide.\\n\\n\\'Can\\'t say I\\'m sorry\\'\\n\\n\"It\\'s been 18 weeks and we haven\\'t been listened to,\" a Yellow Vest participant named John, from the eastern city of Nancy, was cited as telling French daily Le Monde on the sidelines of the demonstration. \"Before, they [the extremists) scared everyone, but now we see it as an advantage. They are the ones who get things moving forward, we are being too pacifist ourselves.\"\\n\\nSixty-year-old Isabelle from Essonne, agreed: \"If I was younger, I\\'d join the clashes too. The biggest violence is that of the government, the one that is triggering the anger.\"\\n\\nOf the near 10,000 Yellow Vests who gathered for the protests, police said that a staggering 1,500 extremists had been identified. Some 240 people were also arrested on Saturday.\\n\\nThe shop windows of Boss, Etam, Nike, Swarowski and numerous other boutiques lining the boulevard were shattered during the demonstration and 11 people suffered minor injuries after the famed brasserie Le Fouquet was set alight, along with a bank and several news kiosks. Police said 42 protesters, 17 officers and one firefighter were also injured.\\n\\n\"Up until now, I\\'ve intervened whenever I\\'ve seen damage being carried out during the demonstrations, but now, I just think to myself \\'too bad\\',\" 39-year old Jennifer, from the Western city of Rouen, said. \"When I saw them attack Le Fouquet- the symbol of oligarchy - I can\\'t say I was satisfied, but I can\\'t say I was sorry either.\"\\n\\nNew attitude\\n\\nAccording to French sociologist Michel Wieviorka, some Yellow Vests have - since their first demonstration four months ago - gradually changed their attitude towards the use of violence during their rallies.\\n\\n\"Some feel that the violence is legitimate - that\\'s the big drama of what this whole movement has brought us,\" he told broadcaster France Inter on Sunday, noting that it is the first time since the 1968 student riots in Paris that violence has returned as a legitimate mode of action.\\n\\n\"The violence is the culmination of a movement which is unable to structure itself and define its leadership and which feels that its demands are less and less listened to,\" he said, but noted that the movement is increasingly being splintered into two separate groups.\\n\\n\"At the road blocks, people are against the violence and have nothing to do with it, it\\'s a social movement... But at the same time there\\'s the Paris protests, on Saturdays, and the violence doesn\\'t have much to do with the road blocks, but the two fuel each other,\" he said.\\n\\nIsolating the rioters\\n\\nSaturday\\'s riots were the worst to hit the capital since December 1, when Paris saw the most violent demonstration in decades, and which included severe vandalism to one of the country\\'s most respected landmarks, the Arc de Triomphe.\\n\\nThat time, however, the Yellow Vest movement fully distanced itself from the violence and condemned it.\\n\\nFollowing the December riots, Macron\\'s government decided to scrap the diesel tax that was the trigger for the rise of the movement, but by the time it was announced, the Yellow Vests had already swelled into a broader movement protesting the president himself, his reforms and French elitism in general.\\n\\nThis led to the 41-year-old leader announcing a concession package worth some €10 billion to boost the incomes of France\\'s poorest. He also launched a \"national debate\" meant to allow the French to have a greater say in France\\'s way forward. Saturday\\'s protest coincided with the end of the debates.\\n\\nMacron\\'s move initially seemed to have worked, with the number of Yellow Vest protesters declining week by week and with public opinion gradually turning against the movement, but Saturday\\'s violence underscored the government\\'s challenge of finding a way to weed out the rioters from the protesters.\\n\\nThe French president, who was forced to cut short a skiing trip in the Pyrénées to return to Paris for a crisis meeting, vowed to take \"strong decisions\" to prevent further violence.\\n\\n\"There are people today who try by all means... to damage the Republic by breaking, by destroying things at the risk of killing someone,\" Macron said.',\n",

       "    'title': \"Why have the 'Yellow Vest' protests spilled over into Belgium?\",\n",
       "    'body': 'The \"gilets jaunes\" or \"Yellow Vests\" movement began in France as a response to a proposed hike on fuel prices. Now it\\'s turned into a large, amorphous protest movement railing more generally against high taxes and the cost of living. And that, at least, is a notion that can\\'t be confined to just France.\\n\\nOn Saturday, December 8, Belgian police fired tear gas and water cannons at \"gilets jaunes\" protesters in the capital, Brussels, as they tried to breach a riot barricade. Meanwhile in Paris, as protesters took to the streets for a fourth successive Saturday of discontent and violence, one slogan rang out above them all: \"Macron, resign!\" So with a protest that seems so fundamentally tied up with the perceived failings of French President Emmanuel Macron\\'s government, how did the Yellow Vests movement transcend borders, sparking demonstrations in neighbouring Belgium?\\n\\nMaking ends meet\\n\\nThe demonstrations in both countries come from the same sense of struggling to make ends meet every month.\\n\\nIt began, in both countries, with the government increasing the cost of fuel. Belgians, for instance, pay the highest state taxes on diesel in Europe. The French government backed down on the proposed fuel tax increase, and Belgian ministers did the same, announcing the fuel prices would not be index-linked from 2019. But in both countries, the protests have continued.\\n\\nHigh tax burden\\n\\nAccording to Eurostat, the European Union\\'s statistical body, tax-to-GDP ratio rose across Europe in 2017. France tops the list, with tax revenue accounting for 48.4% of GDP, and Belgium follows close behind with a tax-to-GDP ratio of 47.3%.\\n\\nThis high tax burden hits the little people hardest: in France, the minimum wage for a 35-hour week comes to just under €1,500 a month before tax and social charges. France pays the highest social contributions in Europe.\\n\\nTo add even more fuel to the flaming barricades of the \"gilets jaunes\" movement in France, the French economic observatory OFCE published a study that noted that disposable income had dropped by €440 on average per household between 2008 and 2016.\\n\\nWhile Macron inherited these problems, he hasn\\'t done much to convince the French populace that he\\'s working to assuage them. The French government has just delayed, for the second time, a long-awaited increase to the minimum wage.\\n\\nFinancial grievances in Belgium\\n\\nEconomist Philippe Defeyt told Belgian media RTBF that while the cost of living has increased in Belgium, so too has the average income - apart from the lowest-earners, who have been squeezed even tighter.\\n\\nA retired man told RTBF that he receives a pension of €1,350 a month. \"I get it on the 23 of the month. It\\'s now the 8 and after I\\'ve paid insurance, rent, energy bills - which cost €150 - I only have €200 left for living expenses,\" he said.\\n\\nA Facebook group for Yellow Vests in Belgium lays out some of their demands to the government: lowering the retirement age, decreasing fuel excise duties, decreasing the cost of electricity and water, the choice of referendums at all levels of legislative decision-making, increasing pensions, improving public services and increasing purchasing power. The average price of electricity has risen €10 in the past year. Protesters describe a general \"ras-le-bol fiscal\", or financial despair.\\n\\nLet them eat waffles\\n\\nFrance\\'s centralised state leaves residents in rural areas feeling ignored by the top levels of government, run by what is seen as the Paris \\'elite\\' who hold all the power - and more importantly, the purse strings.\\n\\nIt\\'s a similar story in Belgium: in Brussels, salaries are €300 higher than the average salary in the rest of the country. With a capital that also doubles as the capital of Europe, Belgian citizens are frustrated by what they see as their lawmakers\\' inability to solve problems closer to home.\\n\\nOne protester gestured to the European institutional buildings behind him while talking to a NBC Euronews reporter. \"There, in \\'Europe\\', they\\'re having fun, they\\'re laughing,\" he said. \"The people who make the laws are the ones driving us further into the ground. We have empty pockets. We shouldn\\'t be called the \\'yellow vests\\', but the \\'empty pockets\\'.\"\\n\\nThe \"Yellow Vest\" demonstrations on December 8 in Brussels were mostly peaceful. Police had blockaded the zone housing the European Commission and European Council, essentially blocking in protesters. There were some clashes when a small group of protesters tried to break through a barricade blocking access to the EU\\'s main institutions. Around 400 were arrested, according to local police, and three police officers were injured.\\n\\nMany of the \"Yellow Vest\" protesters denounced the \"casseurs\", literally \"breakers\", and sought to dissociate themselves from the violent fringes of the demonstration. But despair over the high cost of living and the loss of purchasing power remains, and Belgian \"Yellow Vest\" protesters are likely to take to the streets again.',\n",

It turned to downpours by mid-evening, scattering many of the remaining demonstrators.\\n\\nRussian bots fomenting unrest?\\n\\nThe outbreaks of violence were on a smaller scale than the destruction and looting of a week earlier, when some 200 cars were torched in the worst rioting in Paris in decades.\\n\\nThe government had vowed \"zero tolerance\" for anarchist, far-right or other trouble-makers seeking to wreak further havoc at protests that have sparked the deepest crisis of Macron\\'s presidency.\\n\\nPrime Minister Edouard Philippe congratulated police for the operation, and promised Macron would address the protesters\\' concerns.\\n\\n\"The dialogue has begun and it must continue,\" Philippe said. \"The president will speak, and will propose measures that will feed this dialogue.\"\\n\\nPolice reinforcements were boosted to 8,000 across the city, with armoured vehicles deployed in Paris for the first time.\\n\\nShops along the Champs-Elysees and central department stores stayed shut with their windows boarded up to avoid looting.\\n\\nThe Eiffel Tower, major museums and many metro stations were also closed as parts of Paris went on effective lockdown.\\n\\nMore than 670 protesters were detained in the capital, many of them stopped as they arrived at train stations or meeting points carrying hammers, petanque balls and other potential missiles.\\n\\nAuthorities also launched an investigation into social media activity from accounts allegedly drumming up support for the protests, sources told AFP.\\n\\nAccording to the UK\\'s Times newspaper, hundreds of online accounts linked to Russia were used to stoke the demonstrations.\\n\\nCiting analysis by New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company, the Times said the accounts spread disinformation and used pictures of injured protesters from other events to enhance a narrative of brutality by French authorities.\\n\\nProtests beyond France\\n\\nOfficials estimated that a total 125,000 \"yellow vests\" turned out nationwide throughout the day, down from 136,000 last week.\\n\\nIn Paris, health authorities said 179 people had been admitted to hospital, mostly with minor injuries.\\n\\nAmong the police, 17 were hurt, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said.\\n\\nThe movement has spread beyond France\\'s borders, with around 400 arrested at a \"yellow vest\" event in Brussels on Saturday and peaceful demonstrations taking place in Dutch towns.\\n\\nThe French protests also attracted the attention of US President Donald Trump.\\n\\n\"Very sad day & night in Paris. Maybe it\\'s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes?\" he tweeted.\\n\\nThe demonstrations are not directly linked to the 2015 Paris climate agreement, which Trump has abandoned to the dismay of Macron and other Western leaders.\\n\\nPeople began blockading French roads on November 17 over rising fuel prices -- partly due to taxes aimed at helping the country transition to a lower-carbon economy.\\n\\nBut the demonstrations have since swollen into a broad movement against ex-banker Macron, whom the protesters accuse of favouring the rich.\\n\\nNationwide, 89,000 police officers were on duty in towns, cities and on numerous motorways which caused havoc on France\\'s road network, including a blockade of a border crossing with Spain.\\n\\nNearly 1,400 people were detained across France, according to Castaner.\\n\\nMacron\\'s U-turn\\n\\nMacron this week gave in to some of the protesters\\' demands for measures to help the poor and struggling middle classes, including scrapping a planned increase in fuel taxes.\\n\\nThat climbdown marked a major departure for a president who had vowed, unlike predecessors, not to be swayed by mass protests.\\n\\nBut many of the \"yellow vests\" are holding out for more.\\n\\nA popular demand is a reversal of his decision to slash taxes on France\\'s wealthiest in a bid to boost investment and create jobs -- something he has so far ruled out.\\n\\nThe policy, along with hikes on pensioners\\' taxes, cuts in housing allowances and a string of comments deemed insensitive to ordinary workers, has led critics to label Macron a \"president of the rich\".\\n\\nFar-right leader Marine Le Pen -- who is backed by some protesters from \"forgotten\" provincial France, but by no means all -- called for Macron to \"recognise society\\'s suffering and deliver immediate, very strong responses\".\\n\\nProtests at dozens of schools over university reforms, and a call by farmers for demonstrations next week, have added to a sense of general revolt in France.',\n",

       "    'body': 'AFP correspondents who talked to demonstrators and observed Saturday\\'s violence found that they did not all come from the same mould.\\n\\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner denounced what he called the \"professionals of disorder\" and destruction who had organised the violence.\\n\\nThe \"casseurs\" (rioters) who smashed up parts of Paris were exploiting the \"yellow vests\" campaign for their own ends, he said.\\n\\nJunior interior minister Laurent Nunez took a similar line, saying the violence had not been carried out by the \"yellow vests\" but by people dressed in camouflage gear.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only the \\'casseurs\\' who came to have a go at the police,\" he said.\\n\\nBut as clouds of tear gas filled the streets of some of the most up-market neighbourhoods of Paris Saturday, the truth seemed a little more complex to AFP journalists on the ground.\\n\\nSome \"yellow vest\" protesters were involved in the wave of destruction. They came from all over France, more often than not in their thirties, and wearing ski masks or workmen\\'s masks.\\n\\nThey were not necessarily hard-core political activists nor veterans of street violence: some of them however were ready to resort to violence to protest against government policies.\\n\\nSome of them helped build the barricades set up in the streets to hamper the advance of the police.\\n\\nDamage the cause\\n\\n\"This violence, it\\'s legitimate,\" said 45-year-old Chantal, who had travelled down from Lorraine, northeast France, with her husband and two children.\\n\\n\"Every month we end up 500 euros in the red. That\\'s three years that we\\'ve not gone on holiday.\"\\n\\nMany other \"yellow vest\" protesters who spoke to AFP nevertheless condemned the violence, saying that it damaged their cause.\\n\\nBeside them were more experienced protesters, some from the hard left, others from the far right -- both more than ready to clash with the authorities, as police sources confirmed.\\n\\nThese people were clearly experienced in the street-fighting tactics used against the police.\\n\\nThey knew how to burn a barricade or a car, and when the police fire tear gas, they gave advice to those around them, telling them not to panic and not to run, AFP journalists on the scene observed.\\n\\nThe presence of hard-left activists was announced by anti-capitalist slogans shouted from some sections of the crowd and the graffiti on the walls of some shops, such as the English acronym ACAB: \"All Cops are Bastards\".\\n\\nAt the other extreme, far-right groups such as Action Francaise and Bastion Social also made their presence known. Both groups had used social media called on their supporters to turn out at Saturday\\'s protests.\\n\\nThen later Saturday younger delinquents appeared, in particular near the Place de la Bastille and on the edges of the Champs-Elysees avenue, where AFP journalists watched them looting a small supermarket and burning a scooter.\\n\\nOnce the courts start processing the cases that came out of Saturday\\'s violence, it will be clearer who was behind the violence.\\n\\nPolice detained nearly 380 people in Paris on Saturday and the courts may fast-track some of those cases through the system.',\n",

       "    'body': 'The French are no strangers to taking to the streets. The burgeoning \"Yellow Vest\" movement, which has vowed to cause widespread disruption for a fifth consecutive Saturday, echoes other rebellions that have brought previous French leaders to heel.\\n\\nDuring the 1789 Revolution that began with the storming of the Bastille, French workers rioted over taxes, economic inequality and perceptions that the country\\'s rulers were out of touch.\\n\\nAnd it seems President Emmanuel Macron has ignited this same spark, rekindling the French citizenry\\'s rebellious tendencies. While democracy has replaced the monarchy in France, the tradition of the masses taking their anger against perceived inequality onto the streets of Paris remains much the same.\\n\\nLast weekend Yellow Vest protesters were responsible for Paris\\'s worst rioting in decades, looting and torching cars in plush neighbourhoods near the Champs-Élysées and graffitiing \"Macron=Louis 16\" and \"King Macron\". Four people have been killed and hundreds have been injured in the protests.\\n\\nMacron, a former Rothschild banker whom critics have long accused of being a \"friend of the rich\", stoked popular anger for doing away with a wealth tax last year and proposing a rise in fuel taxes that campaigners say will hurt the poorest.\\n\\n\"We have all kinds of different social categories that have united under what we call \\'The People\\', which has deep roots in French history,\" sociologist Michel Fize told FRANCE 24 on the eve of new protests. \"It\\'s become a very inclusive movement.\"\\n\\nHe noted that unions representing students, farmers and truck drivers have recently joined the struggle.\\n\\n\"There\\'s reason to believe that other groups will join in too, because all social categories are affected by modern-day social injustice,\" Fize said.\\n\\nAnd the Yellow Vests have widespread backing. In a survey conducted by the Elabe institute for broadcaster BFMTV earlier this week, 46 percent of the French say they \"support\" them while 26 percent \"sympathise\" with their cause.\\n\\nOn Wednesday the French president caved. Macron abandoned the fuel-tax hike, but not before his image as an unshakeable leader was severely damaged.\\n\\n\"If people compare Macron to Louis XVI, it\\'s a warning that he has hasn\\'t learned the lesson of history,\" sociologist Michel Wieviorka told the Associated Press. \"They don\\'t literally want his head, but it\\'s a strong message that they don\\'t feel listened to.\"\\n\\nThe concessions haven\\'t appeased the protesters, who said it was too little too late. With wages stagnant, unemployment above 9 percent and growing frustration at France\\'s taxes, which are among the highest in Europe, some Yellow Vests now want to topple the government.\\n\\n>> Reporters: What do France\\'s \\'Yellow Vest\\' protesters want?\\n\\nProtest may be such a recurrent part of French history simply because it has often succeeded. Paris\\'s very design was intended to thwart mass protest after the 19th-century revolutions that toppled monarchies.\\n\\n\"The founding moment of French political history was the Revolution. Since then, French people speak directly to power through protest. Although not necessarily in such a bloody way,\" Wieviorka said.\\n\\nAn unidentified Yellow Vest protester in the southwestern Bouches du Rhône region also touched on the historic roots of France\\'s protest tradition when speaking to national broadcaster France 2 on Friday.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a good revolution. It needs to be peaceful, and it needs to be successful. But it must not become another 1789,\" he said.\\n\\nFifty years ago, students at Sorbonne University erected barricades in a challenge to the status quo. The violence that authorities used to suppress the protesters brought French workers onto the streets, and the swelling 1968 movement that eventually numbered 9 million people brought France to its knees.\\n\\nThe uprising led to a 35 percent rise in the minimum wage and salary increases of 10 percent. But it undermined the legitimacy of president Charles de Gaulle, who stood down the following year.\\n\\nMass demonstrations also forced the French government to ditch plans to reform the university selection process in 1986, the reform of public transport workers\\' pensions in 1995 and the introduction of a lower wage scale for recent university graduates in 2006.\\n\\nThe memory of the 1830 and 1848 revolutions (which led to the creation of France\\'s Second Republic) as well as other, smaller uprisings are indelibly printed on the French psyche.\\n\\nThe tumult following the 1830 revolution was immortalised in Victor Hugo\\'s \"Les Misérables,\" a classic of French literature and one of the most famous musicals of all time, which culminates in a confrontation on the barricades during the 1832 Paris Uprising.\\n\\nIn later decades, fearing such protests could threaten his grip on power, Napoleon III enlisted the help of Baron Haussmann to re-plan the notoriously narrow streets of Paris into wide, easily accessibly boulevards starting in 1853 - giving birth to the wide avenues of the modern French capital. It was thought this would stop the building of barricades that hindered soldiers from restoring order.\\n\\nBut the country\\'s long tradition of protest has stubbornly outlasted all attempts to stymie it, as the Yellow Vest protesters who are still erecting barricades have demonstrated.',\n",

One of the officers is then beaten by other protesters wearing yellow vests before he is rescued by fellow riot police in protective equipment and helmets.\\n\\nThe ex-boxer, identified by French media as 37-year-old Christophe Dettinger, is a former heavyweight professional fighter who reportedly works for the local government in the Essonne area south of Paris.\\n\\n\"Sir, you knocked a colleague to the ground. You have been identified,\" said a tweet from France\\'s SCPN police union said. \"For a boxer, apparently you don\\'t respect any of the rules. You are going to learn those of the criminal code.\"\\n\\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner said Dettinger, known in the ring as \"The Gypsy From Massy\", a town south of Paris, had handed himself into police in the capital.\\n\\n\"He was immediately arrested and will be held accountable for his acts by the justice system,\" Castaner added.\\n\\nThe French boxing federation issued a statement condemning the violence, saying that it \"ran completely contrary to the values of our sport\".\\n\\n\"The French Boxing Federation sends its support to the family and loved ones of the officer who was a victim of this individual, but equally to all the security forces who have been on duty these last weeks,\" it said.\\n\\nBut Dettinger\\'s former coach, Jacky Trompesauce, said Dettinger\\'s action had been a response to police violence against a woman.\\n\\n\"There was something that set it off, which I learned overnight,\" Trompesauce told RMC radio on Monday morning. \"There was a women who was attacked by CRS (riot police).\"\\n\\nAttacking and injuring a police officer in France can lead to up to three years in prison and a fine of €45,000, though sentences can be increased in certain circumstances.\\n\\nAround 50,000 Yellow Vest protesters took to the streets again on Saturday in cities around France to denounce the centrist government of President Emmanuel Macron, leading to clashes in Paris, Bordeaux and Rouen.\\n\\nForklift truck smashes ministry\\n\\nSeveral men driving a forklift truck also smashed open the doors to the ministry building of government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux in Paris, who denounced the break-in as an \"unacceptable attack on the Republic\".\\n\\nWhile the number of protesters has dwindled since December, the determination of a smaller but increasingly radical core of Yellow Vest protesters poses a dilemma for the government.\\n\\nOn Friday, Griveaux said those still protesting were \"agitators who want insurrection and, basically, to overthrow the government\".\\n\\nHe called Monday for everyone to take part in a national debate on taxation and the government\\'s pro-business programme, which is set to begin later this month.\\n\\nBudget Minister Gérald Darmanin sought to distinguish genuine protesters, who want lower taxes and more help for low-income families, from those \"who are in the business of ultra-violence\".\\n\\n\"And faced with ultra-violence, we need to be ultra-severe. It needs to end,\" he told RTL radio on Monday.\\n\\nFrench police signalled a tougher line last week when they arrested one of the leaders of the Yellow Vests, truck driver Eric Drouet, for organising an unauthorised demonstration.\\n\\nThe move led to criticism from political leaders on the far right and radical left, who have encouraged demonstrators to continue taking to the streets to underline their discontent with Macron\\'s agenda.\\n\\nImages of a policeman striking several protesters in the southern city of Toulon on Saturday also risk fanning the flames.\\n\\nThe police officer, a commander who was granted France\\'s highest award, the Legion d\\'Honneur, on January 1, was referred to investigators at the weekend after appearing to punch a protester in the face several times.',\n",

       "    'body': 'France\\'s Yellow Vest protesters began gathering in cities throughout the country on Saturday in \"Act VIII\" of their movement against French President Emmanuel Macron\\'s economic policies.\\n\\nThe Yellow Vests movement, named after the hi-vis jacket worn by its protesters, is calling for people to gather at symbolic and historical sites across France - from the Hôtel de Ville in Paris, to the Place de la Bourse in Bordeaux, and the Place du Capitole in Toulouse.\\n\\nThe first protests of 2019 could be more heated after one of the faces of the leaderless movement, Eric Drouet, was detained on Wednesday for organising an undeclared protest. Drouet, who was later released on Thursday afternoon, was amongst those who called for a demonstration on the Champs-Élysées on December 1, a protest that escalated into the worst violence the French capital had seen in more than five decades. More than 100 cars were set on fire, the Arc de Triomphe was vandalised and balaclava-clad protesters fought running battles with police.\\n\\nDrouet is already facing trial for carrying a wooden stick at a previous protest, which is considered a weapon.\\n\\nThis mock-up map created by French daily Le Parisien and shared by a French journalist on Twitter shows possible routes protesters can take on their marches in Paris on Saturday.\\n\\nNo hi-vis jackets for Saturday\\'s protests\\n\\nFor Saturday\\'s protests, Yellow Vests urged their fellow demonstrators to take to the streets without donning their signature hi-vis clothing, so that they draw less attention from police.\\n\\nThe French government has dialled back the number of police deployed across the country, to 3,600 riot police and police officers. Paris authorities won\\'t be using water cannons or armoured riot vehicles, as they have done in previous weeks.\\n\\nA women-only Yellow Vest protest has also been organised for Sunday in the capital, garnering a lot of support on social media. It\\'s the first time that women have broken off from the broader movement to launch their own demonstration.\\n\\nSupport for the movement has waned in recent weeks, with some 12,000 protesters showing up on the Champs-Élysées on the final Saturday of 2018 - a sharp decline from the 40,000 protesters in the French capital in \"Act II\" of the demonstrations.\\n\\nAttendance throughout the country also dwindled. Some 282,000 protesters on November 17 had dropped to 66,000 by December 15, according to government statistics. But the Yellow Vests are keen to show that the movement hasn\\'t completely died out, and that their anger and discontent remains unchanged.\\n\\nThe movement began in November last year over a hike in fuel taxes, but quickly escalated into an expression of wider discontent against Macron\\'s economic policies.\\n\\nSpurred by anger over a perceived squeeze on household income, the movement has shaken Macron\\'s presidency and hurt retailers and other businesses.\\n\\nIn mid-December, following weeks of protests, Macron was forced to make concessions. He scrapped the controversial fuel tax rise, promised extra cash for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners.\\n\\nMacron vows to push ahead with reforms\\n\\nMacron, who swept to power in May 2017 promising to transform France, is vowing to keep reforming the country and pushing ahead with changes to France\\'s national unenmployment insurance and pension system.\\n\\n\"We must probably make further changes, be more radical,\" said Macron in comments reported by government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux after the first Cabinet meeting of the year on Friday.\\n\\nGriveaux called on the French to express their views during a \"national debate\" organised in the coming weeks in all regions, rather than by taking to the streets.\\n\\nHe called those who are still protesting within the yellow vest movement \"agitators who want insurrection and to overthrow the government\".',\n",

The measures should come into force early in 2019.\\n\\nEarlier Friday Prime Minister Edouard Philippe visited the Haute-Vienne region of central France to discuss grievances of disgruntled rural-dwellers with local mayors.\\n\\nPhilippe was greeted by demonstrators shouting \"Macron resign,\" in a reference to President Emmanuel Macron.\\n\\nElsewhere, some \"gilets jaunes\" sought to keep pressure on the government to further boost spending power and give citizens more of a say in lawmaking by staging sporadic protests.\\n\\nIn Pfastatt, eastern France, 14 demonstrators trying to block access to a factory supplying parts to PSA Peugeot Citroen, Europe\\'s second-biggest carmaker, were arrested by police.\\n\\nIn the southwestern city of Toulouse, some 30 protesters held a rally lampooning Macron on his 41st birthday.\\n\\n\"We haven\\'t brought him any presents because he hasn\\'t given us any,\" said one protester.\\n\\nThe number of protesters has however fallen significantly since last week, when Macron, a pro-business centrist, gave into some of their demands.\\n\\nThe interior ministry estimated the numbers taking part in various protests on Thursday at under 4,000, the lowest since demonstrations began on November 17, with 282,000 taking part on the first Saturday.\\n\\nThe number of traffic roundabouts occupied by protesters in yellow high-visibility vests over the past five weeks has also markedly dropped.\\n\\nSome 300 have been cleared by police since mid-December, with 200 still occupied, the interior ministry said Friday.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Paris police and store owners are bracing for new violence at protests Saturday, despite President Emmanuel Macron\\'s surrender over a fuel tax hike that unleashed weeks of unrest.\\n\\nPolice unions and local authorities held emergency meetings Thursday to strategize - while disparate groups of protesters did the same, sharing plans on social networks and chat groups.\\n\\nSome \"yellow vest\" protesters called for calm Thursday after the worst rioting in Paris in decades last weekend. Many shops and restaurants in the center of the capital are shutting down Saturday, fearing a repeat of the violence.\\n\\nMacron on Wednesday agreed to abandon the fuel tax hike, but protesters\\' demands have now expanded to other issues.\\n\\nScores of protesting teens clashed with police at a high school west of Paris on Thursday, according to French news reports, as part of nationwide student actions over university admissions procedures and rising administrative fees. Drivers wearing their signature yellow safety vests continued to block roads around France, now demanding broader tax cuts and government aid.\\n\\nA small union representing police administrative personnel called for a strike Saturday, which could further complicate security measures Saturday. Other police unions are not talking about strikes - but two police union officials told The Associated Press they are worried about radical troublemakers and others taking advantage of the protest atmosphere to cause even greater damage this Saturday.\\n\\nEveryone is worried about risks in the face of a movement with no clear leaders whose protests are easily hijacked by troublemakers of all stripes. The government is contributing to the fear with dire warnings about new violence by extremists or other troublemakers. \"We cannot let these rebels continue to threaten the nation,\" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said Thursday.\\n\\nPolice have come under criticism for failing to prevent damage to the Arc de Triomphe and stores along the famed Champs-Elysees in central Paris, as well as for violence against protesters.\\n\\nVideos circulating on social media of police beating protesters at a Burger King on the Champs-Elysees have deepened the anger. A police spokeswoman said Thursday an investigation is underway into that incident, and that police are examining other videos shared online for possible violations.\\n\\nMacron himself, the central target of the protests, has been largely invisible all week. After winning election overwhelmingly last year, the 40-year-old pro-business centrist alienated many of his own voters with tax cuts for the rich and other badly explained reforms - and what many see as his elitist, out-of-touch attitude.\\n\\nHe doesn\\'t face re-election until 2022 and his party has a strong majority in parliament, but his political opponents are increasingly vocal and plan a no-confidence vote in the government next week.\\n\\nThe government is trying to calm tensions but not succeeding so far. The transport minister met Thursday with truckers\\' unions, but they maintained their plans to go on strike Sunday over overtime bonuses.\\n\\nThe rioting in Paris has worried tourists, prompted the cancellation of four French league soccer matches this weekend around the country, and damaged the local economy at the height of the holiday shopping season. Rampaging groups threw cobblestones through storefronts and looted valuables in some of the city\\'s richest neighborhoods.\\n\\nClement Rozey, manager of a motorcycle shop in western Paris, spent two days and two nights cleaning up after he watched powerless as a group of thugs smashed his shop windows and emptied his shelves.\\n\\nHe has boarded up the store and will stay closed Saturday.\\n\\n\"We\\'re going to have a security company with security guards inside and outside the shop,\" Rozey told the AP. \"Everything has been fenced off, several times.\"\\n\\nYet he remains sympathetic to the protest movement.\\n\\n\"Just like everybody, we\\'re strangled (financially) after the 15th of the month,\" he said, referring to the day when many workers are paid. The protesters \"are defending a cause, they\\'re following through and rightly so. We support them whole-heartedly,\" he said. But violent troublemakers who pillage and riot - \"that\\'s something else.\"',\n",

       "    'body': 'Masked, black-clad groups ran amok across central Paris on Saturday, torching cars and buildings, looting shops, smashing windows and fighting police in the worst unrest the capital has seen since 1968, posing the most formidable challenge Emmanuel Macron has faced in his 18-month-old presidency.\\n\\nDisturbances also rocked several cities and towns and across France - from Charleville Mezieres in the northeast to Nantes in the west and Marseille in the south.\\n\\n\"We have to think about the measures that can be taken so that these incidents don\\'t happen again,\" government spokeswoman Benjamin Griveaux told Europe 1 radio.\\n\\nThe popular rebellion erupted out of nowhere on Nov. 17 and has spread quickly via social media, with protesters blocking roads across France and impeding access to shopping malls, factories and some fuel depots.\\n\\nThe protests began as a backlash against Macron\\'s fuel tax hikes, but have mined a vein of deep dissatisfaction felt towards the 40-year-old\\'s liberal economic reforms, which many voters feel favour the wealthy and big business.\\n\\nAccording to figures released by the French interior ministry, around 75,000 demonstrators took to the streets across France on Saturday. The headcount was significantly lower than for the last two \"Yellow Vest\" protests, which drew roughly 300,000 and 100,000 respectively.\\n\\nAuthorities were caught off guard by Saturday\\'s escalation in violence overshadowing the spontaneous protest movement, dubbed the \"Yellow Vest\" protest because many participants are wearing the fluorescent safety jackets kept in all cars in France.\\n\\nIn Paris, police said they had arrested more than 400 people while 133 were injured, including 23 members of the security forces. Police fired stun grenades, tear gas and water cannon at protesters at the top of the Champs-Elysées boulevard, at the Tuillèries Garden near the Louvre museum and other sites.\\n\\nMacron chairing emergency cabinet meeting\\n\\nMacron will hold an emergency meeting with the prime minister and interior minister later on Sunday to discuss the riots and how to begin dialogue with the \"Yellow Vest\" protesters, who have no real structure or leadership.\\n\\nWhen asked about imposing a state of emergency, Griveaux said it would be among the options considered on Sunday.\\n\\n\"It is out of the question that each weekend becomes a meeting or ritual for violence.\"\\n\\nGriveaux urged the \"Yellow Vest\" movement to disassociate itself from the radical groups that had instigated the violence, organise itself and come to the negotiating table. However, he ruled out a change in government policy.\\n\\n\"We won\\'t change course. It\\'s the right direction. We are certain of that,\" he said.\\n\\n>> \\'Yellow Vest\\' delegates refuse meeting with French PM because not filmed\\n\\nAuthorities said violent groups from the far right and far left as well as \"thugs\" from the suburbs had infiltrated the \"Yellow Vest\" movement in Paris on Saturday, though Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said most of those arrested were regular protesters who had been egged on by fringe groups.\\n\\nSpeaking on BFM TV late on Saturday, Castaner said the authorities had put all security measures in place to forestall disturbances, but that they had faced extremely violent, organised and determined groups.\\n\\nHe did however say the government had made a mistake in how it communicated its plans to move away from oil dependence, the policy which led to fuel tax hikes.\\n\\nPaul Marra, a \"Yellow Vest\" activist in Marseille, told BFM TV that the government was to blame for the violence across the country. \"We condemn what happened, but it was inevitable. The violence started from the top. The biggest thug is the state through its inaction.\"',\n",

       "    'body': 'For months, French feminists have circled November 24 in their calendars as a day for nationwide marches to protest violence against women. But last-minute blockades staged by the country\\'s \"yellow vests\" risk eclipsing the women\\'s message.\\n\\n\"YellowVests, please leave us November 24,\" @layemeraude tweeted when organisers behind France\\'s anti-fuel tax movement earlier this week announced a new round of road blockades this Saturday. \"It\\'s the day for #Nous_Toutes, the day for when marches against sexist and sexual violence have been organised in all of France, it\\'s been planned for months! We really need this exposure!\" she wrote.\\n\\n#NousToutes, which roughly translates into \"All of us (women)\", is a French grassroots movement that was born this summer when several of the country\\'s feminist groups got together and decided to take last year\\'s #MeToo campaign one step further and call more attention to sexist and sexual violence against women. In September, the group organised its first protest action, garnering some 600 people in Paris and a total of 4,000 across France.\\n\\nAccording to French government figures, some 225,000 women are victim to domestic violence each year. Femicide, or the killing of a woman because of her gender, accounts for a fifth of all murders in the country. In 2016, a total of 123 women were reported to have been killed by their current or former partners, an equivalent to roughly one woman every three days. In addition, authorities say more than 250 women are raped in France every day, and as many as one in three have been sexually assaulted or harassed in their workplace at least once.\\n\\nThe second wave of protests was planned for November 24 - the day before the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.\\n\\nThe idea is \"to make society more aware of the extent of sexist and sexual violence\", Madeline Da Silva, one of the organisers, told FRANCE 24. \"[The aim] is to send an electric shock through society so that it puts its foot down and says, \\'Stop\\'.\"\\n\\n\"Thousands of people are expected in Paris and we have 100 local networks [who have committed] and 50 marches in France,\" she said.\\n\\nThe movement has won strong backing from several French celebrities, including writers Marie Darrieussecq and Annie Ernaux as well as actors Philippe Torreton and Karine Viard. On Friday, unions representing more than 400 French female journalists, teachers, lawyers and caregivers also threw their weight behind the campaign.\\n\\n\\'Yellow vests\\' focused on Paris\\n\\nBut the scheduled marches risk being overshadowed, or even disrupted, by parallel protests staged by the so-called \"yellow vest\" movement, which have erupted over the government\\'s recent tax hike on diesel. The movement - named after the high-visibility vests that French drivers are required to carry in their vehicles - held its first protests on November 17, with nearly 300,000 people mounting barricades or using their bodies to block access to motorways, tunnels and airports across France. On Monday, organisers called on their supporters to protest again, urging them to come out in force this Saturday, especially in Paris.\\n\\nAlthough Da Silva said she wasn\\'t worried about the \"yellow vests\" disrupting the #NousToutes protests, their planned blockades have already prompted at least one local organiser to cancel Saturday\\'s march. In a Facebook post, the organiser in Bourg-en-Bresse said she was worried the blockages would result in \"people not being able to access the location\", and said she couldn\\'t guarantee the safety and security of those taking part in the march.\\n\\n\\'Shame on you\\'\\n\\nIn the past week, social media has also been awash with #NousToutes supporters calling on the yellow vests to postpone their protests. \"On November 24, there is already the #NousToutes protest against violence against women. It would be very nice of the #YellowVests to ensure roundabouts are fluid, to leave cities accessible and to not protest. Thanks in advance,\" Laurence Rossignol, the former French minister for family, children and women\\'s rights, tweeted.\\n\\nMarlène Schiappa, France\\'s minister for gender equality, said she would ensure \"that participants, whatever their message against sexist and sexual violence might be, can express them in their totality and be heard! I respect the citizen dimension [of the movement] and wish #NousToutes all success\".\\n\\nOthers have been more aggressive in their calls for the \"yellow vests\" to back off from their protests. \"You\\'re rendering the women who fight invisible. Shame on you. You could choose any other day. Shame shame shame,\" a Twitter user going under the handle @CerridwenDraw said in response to a \"yellow vest\" defending his decision to take part in Saturday\\'s blockages.\\n\\nHowever, a defiant Da Silva told FRANCE 24 that she remains confident that the #NousToutes movement will be successful in getting its message out: \"I think that if there are people in the streets, the media are sure to talk about it. Because this is historic, because it\\'s the first time in 15 years that all unions call on their members to march for the same cause.\"',\n",

In 2014, Bouteflika registered in person.\\n\\nSunday, police deployed massively around the council and the road leading to it was blocked.\\n\\nProtesters to be \\'disappointed\\'\\n\\nSix candidates have already registered, including prominent retired general Ali Ghediri, who was the first to announce he would run for the presidency calling it a \"major challenge\" and promising a \"change\".\\n\\nBusinessman Rachid Nekkaz, who has cultivated a mass following among young people, said he would follow suit on Sunday afternoon.\\n\\nAn analyst who declined to be identified said Sellal\\'s sacking could be a tactic to calm the growing protest movement.\\n\\nAn editorial Sunday in El-Moudjahid newspaper, a mouthpiece of the government, said protesters would be \"disappointed\" in their campaign to force Bouteflika to pull out of the election race.\\n\\nThe sacking of Sellal came after more than a week of demonstrations by Algerians, including lawyers and students, in several cities, including Algiers where protests have officially been banned since 2001.\\n\\nThe first major protest drew tens of thousands on February 22 with demonstrators chanting \"No fifth mandate\".\\n\\nThe scale of the protests has surprised many in Algeria and represents the biggest challenge in years to the authorities.\\n\\nTear gas and stones\\n\\nOn Friday, clashes erupted between police and protesters in Algiers as tens of thousands of people took to the streets.\\n\\nRiot police used tear gas and batons to keep some protesters from marching on the Government Palace, which houses the prime minister\\'s office, AFP reporters said.\\n\\nAccording to a police toll, 56 police officers and seven demonstrators were hurt and 45 alleged stone-throwers were arrested in Algiers.\\n\\nThe state news agency APS, meanwhile, said a total of 183 people had been injured and one person died of a heart attack.\\n\\nBouteflika has been in power for two decades, gaining respect from many for his role in ending a civil war in the 1990s that officials say killed nearly 200,000 people.\\n\\nOfficials have warned that the protests risk dragging Algeria into instability, with the prime minister comparing the rallies to those that sparked Syria\\'s war.\\n\\nProtesters have been mobilised by calls on social media, which have resonated with young Algerians, many of whom struggle for employment in a country where half the population is under 30.\\n\\nReporters at state radio have complained that their bosses have imposed a blackout on coverage of the protests, and last week journalists also took to the streets to protest against alleged censorship.',\n",

Abuse of power. A politicised police targeting and harassing the leaders of the Yellow Vest movement,\" Mélenchon tweeted.\\n\\nDrouet, a 33-year-old truck driver who became known through his Facebook videos, often appears on television as an \"apolitical\" spokesman for the Yellow Vest movement.\\n\\nHe has been criticised for peddling conspiracy theories online and accused of voting for Le Pen in elections last year, which he has denied.\\n\\nDrouet was arrested last month for carrying a wooden stick at a demonstration, and he faces trial on June 5 for \"carrying a prohibited category D weapon\", a judicial source told AFP.\\n\\nMacron\\'s concessions\\n\\nThe Yellow Vest demonstrations - named after the high-visibility jackets worn by protesters - began in rural France in November over fuel taxes, but ballooned into a wider revolt against President Emmanuel Macron\\'s policies and governing style.\\n\\nDrouet took the lead in calling for protesters to hold the first rally on the Champs-Elysées on December 1, a demonstration which turned violent, with \"yellow vests\" clashing with police amid flaming barricades.\\n\\nIn mid-December, after weeks of violence, Macron scrapped planned fuel tax rises in response to the protests and promised extra cash for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners.\\n\\nSince then, the movement has waned and support among the general public has fallen.\\n\\nOnly a couple of hundred of \"yellow vests\" turned up for the last round of demonstrations on the Champs-Elysées on New Year\\'s Eve. They were swamped by tens of thousands of revellers ringing in the new year.\\n\\nBut \"yellow vests\" have promised to return in force to the streets this Saturday.\\n\\nOpinion polls suggest the French are evenly divided over whether the protest movement should continue.',\n",

       "    'title': \"'Yellow Vests': France fuel fight fired up on Facebook\",\n",
       "    'body': 'France has struggled to douse Yellow Vest fuel-tax protests that have laid waste to symbols like the Champs-Élysées in a pall of tear gas and car fires. All over the country, Facebook users who lit the spark have been fanning the flames in real-time.\\n\\nBack in October, months into a burgeoning campaign to halt new taxes on fuel, Jacline Mouraud issued a clarion call, apparently from the comfort of her own home, in a video she posted to Facebook. Addressing French President Emmanuel Macron directly, she demanded, \"When will the hounding of drivers, that you have put into place since you arrived, end?!\"\\n\\nThe silver-maned 51-year-old\\'s sundry list of grievances for \"Monsieur Macron\" included the rising price of diesel, the traffic radars proliferating on French roads and a congestion tax being mooted for big cities in order to fight pollution. \"What do you do with French people\\'s cash?\" she asked repeatedly, angrily, before entreating her Facebook audience to \"each make your own video to say that you have had it\". Mouraud\\'s appeal clearly struck a chord: it racked up 6.2 million views and more than 263,000 shares on Facebook.\\n\\nIn the weeks that followed, the \"Yellow Vest\" movement flourished on the social network, spurring more than 1,500 Facebook-related events locally and across the country on the first day of mass protests alone, on November 17.\\n\\nSome of the most popular Yellow Vest Facebook groups have come to rival the populations of significant French cities. \"La France en colère!!!\" (France in anger), a group created by Eric Drouet, a 33-year-old truck driver, boasts more than 200,000 members.\\n\\n\\'Filter bubble\\'\\n\\nFrench social media journalist Vincent Glad has called Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg the Yellow Vest movement\\'s \"best ally\".\\n\\n\"The movement has without a doubt been helped by the new Facebook algorithm that overemphasises content from groups to the detriment of content posted by pages (and therefore by media outlets),\" Glad wrote for the left-leaning daily Libération. \"After a few likes for a group, we find ourselves submerged with that group\\'s content in our news feeds. The new algo pushed the Yellow Vests into a \\'filter bubble\\' in which they hardly see content anymore that isn\\'t yellow.\"\\n\\nAmid criticism for its role in spreading \"Fake News\", not least in the wake of the 2016 US presidential election, Facebook sought to shift its technical emphasis away from traditional media and towards interactions between individual users. In his February 2017 letter to the social-media behemoth\\'s users, a post entitled \"Building Global Community\", Zuckerberg touted the role Facebook, and notably Facebook groups, could play in \"establishing a new process for citizens worldwide to participate in collective decision-making\".\\n\\nWhile reporters covering the \"Yellow Vest\" protests have been targets of violence, with journalists viewed askance as elites out of touch with the voiceless masses the movement aspires to represent, Facebook groups have stepped in to fill a perceived void. The social network\\'s semblance of transparency, and the unparalleled sense of immediacy it provides, has fed the movement\\'s urge to play by its own rules.\\n\\nWhen \"Yellow Vest\" representatives including Drouet met with Environment Minister François de Rugy last Tuesday at Macron\\'s invitation, the trucker-turned-Facebook-personality dared film the meeting in secret, broadcasting the proceedings and their aftermath on Facebook Live for nearly 90 minutes without authorisation.\\n\\nThe movement\\'s attachment to just that sort of uncompromising mass participation was on full display three days later when Jason Herbert, one of the movement\\'s proclaimed (although disputed) spokespeople, met Prime Minister Édouard Philippe. After arriving 35 minutes late to his Friday meeting at the PM\\'s office, Herbert stayed only a few minutes before leaving again. \"I asked several times that the meeting be filmed and broadcast live on television. That was refused,\" Herbert explained to reporters after cutting short the talks.\\n\\n\\'Uncorrupted, unfiltered\\'\\n\\n\"Right now in France, traditional TV is trailing a social [media] sphere seen as uncorrupted by the elites, unfiltered, and more authentic,\" French journalist and Stanford research fellow Frederic Filloux wrote Monday. \"For the demonstrators ... because Facebook is the expression of the people, then it doesn\\'t lie. When it carries obvious fake news, such as images of protesters shot two years ago [in] Spain or spreads rumours of tanks ready to move against Yellow Vests (15,000 interactions), the quick debunking by mainstream media is lost in the noise,\" Filloux added.\\n\\nSocial media has made veritable celebrities of a handful of Facebook-savvy torchbearers, with some even invited to provide added insight on primetime TV. Maxime Nicolle, who calls himself \"Fly Rider\" on Facebook, is one such sudden celebrity. He posts Facebook Live videos that can draw audiences into the hundreds of thousands to watch him expound on the movement, sometimes while smoking or munching on crisps.\\n\\n\"They aren\\'t even capable of keeping hold of their Arc de Triomphe,\" Nicolle, a gas mask slung around his neck, said in a video filmed live Saturday beneath the Paris monument. Panning the pavement for spent tear-gas cartridges deployed against protesters during Saturday\\'s violent clashes, Nicolle chides law enforcement. \"They deploy teargas from everywhere. They don\\'t even know what to do anymore. They are completely lost,\" Nicolle says, occasionally interrupted by apparent fans off-camera, in the video seen by 150,000 on Facebook. Standing in a crowd of fluorescent-clad demonstrators, Nicolle refers to Macron by the diminutive \"Manu\", warning the president that protesters \"will not give up\" and accusing the French leader of \"starving\" and \"killing his people\".\\n\\nAs it happens, \"Fly Rider\" has been accused of playing fast and loose with the truth, crossing a fine line between bearing witness and spreading unverified information. In one Facebook Live over the weekend, he repeatedly held that police officers had disguised themselves as destructive troublemakers among the demonstrators and that video footage provided evidence of the ruse. But after reviewing several of the videos in question, France 24\\'s Observers could not conclude they corroborated those allegations.\\n\\nIndeed, the Yellow Vest movement\\'s symbiosis with Facebook is a tale of social media at its best and worst alike. Jacline Mouraud\\'s experience is a striking illustration. As the fed-up unknown who gave voice to popular angst in October with her lo-fi video manifesto, she became one of the amorphous \"Yellow Vest\" movement\\'s standard-bearers. But that sudden acclaim has manifested an uglier side.\\n\\n\"From today, ALL THREATS made against me will be subject to a COMPLAINT FILED [with the police],\" Mouraud wrote on Facebook on November 19, just a month after her celebrated post and two days after the first national \"Yellow Vest\" demonstrations. \"My video crystallised the suffering of the people, but it also crystallised jealousy, calumny, defamation. I\\'m not here to be insulted, for people to invent my life story. At last word, apparently I\\'m paid by the government!\" she wrote.\\n\\nDeath threats\\n\\nMouraud told Agence France-Presse on Monday that she had already filed six complaints with police for death threats. She said the threats worsened after she added her signature to an op-ed over the weekend in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper alongside other members of the \"Gilets jaunes libres\", the \"Free Yellow Vests\", making proposals to end the crisis. The group was invited to meet the prime minister on Tuesday to discuss their proposals, but it ultimately declined the invitation, citing threats received on social media. Mouraud had suggested to AFP that the threats were coming from elements within the Yellow Vest movement itself.\\n\\nAs the movement began to take hold in the streets back on November 17, French social media journalist Jules Darmanin tweeted ironically: \"The Yellow Vests materialised thanks to Facebook groups. It is therefore logical that they end up the same way: poorly moderated, corrupted by toxic elements and filled with people with different visions for the same group.\"\\n\\nThe future of the movement may or may not bear out that pessimistic prophecy. But with Prime Minister Philippe now poised to suspend the fuel tax hike that spurred the revolt, the contempt-turned-community via Facebook can claim a measure of victory. Perhaps the writing was on the wall, so to speak.',\n",

But the effects of his pro-business reforms on unemployment and purchasing power have been limited so far.\\n\\nHe has seen his popularity slide to just 25 percent, according to one poll a week ago, and the protests reflect broader frustration with a leader critics label as aloof and a \"president of the rich\".\\n\\nSunday morning, a number of protests continued, notably in southern France, where \\'yellow vests\\' picketed the entrance to a motorway in Saint-Maximin and blockaded traffic in and around Avignon.\\n\\nProtesters were also calling on social media for another national demonstration next Saturday.\\n\\nThe interior ministry said however that the number of protesters across France had dwindled from 282,000 on November 17 to 106,000 Saturday.\\n\\n\\'Expect revolts\\'\\n\\nMacron, who took to Twitter on Saturday, to condemn the violence and cry \"shame\" on those who assaulted or intimidated policemen, journalists and other citizens, was in Brussels Sunday for a short summit of European Union leaders on Britain\\'s Brexit deal.\\n\\nHe was to return to Paris early to work on the speech he will give Tuesday on ecological transition, an opportunity which many politicians suggest he should use to announce measures to soften the impact of rising petrol taxes and restore public dialogue with trade unions and others on how to improve living standards.\\n\\n\"When you act like Louis XIV, you can expect revolts (...) The French back the \\'yellow vests\\' because Macron promised them a new world, and they see that his policies aren\\'t delivering -- neither an increase in purchasing power, nor a drop in unemployment, with ever higher taxes and spending,\" Bruno Retailleau, who heads the Republican opposition in the Senate.\\n\\nThe French \"see environmental matters as an alibi for fiscal belt-tightening,\" he told le Journal du Dimanche newspaper.\\n\\nThe \"yellow vests\" come overwhelmingly from non-urban areas of France. They feel overlooked and penalised by policies they see as being pushed through by elitist politicians in Paris.\\n\\nMany of the often low-income \"yellow vest\" protesters are particularly incensed at Macron\\'s decision to hike anti-pollution taxes on diesel, while scrapping a wealth tax on the rich.\\n\\n\"I\\'m not just fighting against the price of fuel. It\\'s about tax, what we pay,\" protester Catherine Marguier told AFP near the village of La Gravelle in northwest France.\\n\\nPrevious rounds of revolts pitting motorists against government took place in 1995, 2000, 2004, and 2008, often when tax increases coincided with high oil prices -- as they have this year.\\n\\nA poll by the Odoxa research group for Le Figaro newspaper this week found that 77 percent of respondents described the current protests as \"justified\".',\n",

       "    'body': 'Fresh clashes in the \"yellow vest\" fuel price protests across France led to more injuries on Sunday, adding to the more than 400 already reported by the government, as some demonstrators vowed to continue their action over the coming days.\\n\\nAround 46,000 people took part across France in a second day of protests, police said, compared to Saturday when close to 300,000 people participated, although there were again clashes with police -- and sometimes motorists.\\n\\nPolice were searching for a driver who forced a road block at Saint-Quentin, northeast France, leaving one protester seriously injured.\\n\\nAnd police used tear gas to break up a gathering of about a thousand protesters near the northern city of Caen, after acts of vandalism and the burning of wooden pallets.\\n\\nThe protesters, nicknamed \"yellow vests\" for the high-visibility jackets they wear, blocked roundabouts, major highways and thoroughfares on Saturday to express anger over increased taxes on fuel and their shrinking purchasing power under President Emmanuel Macron.\\n\\nFrench Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Sunday evening said the government would stay the course, but acknowledged the \"suffering\" expressed by the protests.\\n\\n\"A government that always changes its stance, zigzagging through difficulties... would not lead France in the right direction,\" he told France 2 television.\\n\\n\"We heard anger but also heard suffering, the lack of prospects, the idea that the authorities for a long time did not respond to the concerns and feeling of abandonment felt by part of the population,\" he said.\\n\\nHe said workers would ultimately have less of a tax burden by the end of Macron\\'s mandate, with some measures already feeding through this year, such as reduced housing tax bills.\\n\\n\\'Idiotic behaviour\\'\\n\\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner earlier reported that the first day and night of protests had left one person dead and more than 400 people hurt, 14 of them seriously.\\n\\nFrench retail group Auchan reported violent incidents at around 20 shopping centres where it operates hypermarkets.\\n\\nThe injured, 409 in total, included 28 police, paramilitary police or firefighters.\\n\\nCastaner told RTL radio that 288,000 people had taken part in Saturday\\'s protests at 2,034 locations countrywide. About 3,500 stayed out overnight, he added.\\n\\nPolice questioned nearly 300 protesters, and took about half of them into custody.\\n\\n\"Last night was restive.... There were assaults, fights, stabbings,\" Castaner said.\\n\\n\"There were fights among \\'yellow vest\\' protesters. There was a lot of alcohol at certain venues, which led to this idiotic behaviour.\"\\n\\nIn the eastern Savoie region, authorities said a woman trying to get her daughter to a doctor panicked after protesters surrounded her car and banged on the roof.\\n\\nShe accelerated into the crowd and killed a 63-year-old woman.\\n\\nThe driver was on Sunday charged with manslaughter before being released on conditional bail, prosecutors said.\\n\\nBudget Minister Gerald Darmanin said Sunday the government was aware of unhappiness over high fuel taxes, but said it had \"a duty\" to transform the French economy with the aim of making it less oil-dependent.\\n\\nA poll published in the Journal de Dimanche weekly said that 62 percent of those questioned believed their purchasing power was more important than a fast transition towards renewable energy.\\n\\nMore to come?\\n\\nIn several spots across the country protesters vowed to carry on their action on Monday and beyond.\\n\\nA spokesman for the movement in the western region of Morbihan said \"tomorrow we will be joined by lorry drivers\", while in the city of Le Mans, southwest of Paris, protesters said that farmers would help them block a major motorway, the A28 leading up to the Picardy coast.\\n\\n\"There are many young people among us because we can\\'t make ends meet anymore,\" said Emilie, a 27-year old temporary sales manager in Cavaillon in the south of the country.\\n\\n\"We work like slaves and at some point enough is enough. We have no life, we\\'re just surviving,\" she said.\\n\\nAnalysts say the movement has come to represent more widespread frustration against Macron, a former investment banker who has pushed through a series of reforms aimed at bolstering economic growth.\\n\\nAnother poll also published in the Journal du Dimanche indicated that Macron\\'s popularity had dipped a further four points to 25 percent.',\n",

Car drivers who witnessed the arrests honked their horns in solidarity and shouted \"Free press\".\\n\\nTwo hours later police, including some in anti-riot gear, broke up the protest which had gathered at the \"Place le la liberte de la presse\" (Press Freedom Square) in central Algiers.\\n\\nThe demonstrators then tried to regroup at the Tahar Djaout Press House where several private newspapers have their offices, but they were again dispersed by the police.\\n\\nState media only started covering the protests on Tuesday after journalist employees publicly complained they were being prevented from doing so. At the same time both the state broadcaster and private channels owned by media magnates close to the government have kept silent about the protests. State radio journalists said they had been ordered by management not to cover them.\\n\\nPM compares protests to Syria\\n\\nAddressing the parliament on Thursday, Algerian Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia compared the growing protest movement to the peaceful demonstrations that erupted in Syria and sparked a war which is now nearing its ninth year.\\n\\nSpeaking in parliament Ouyahia said some \"demonstrators offered roses to the policemen. But we should recall that in Syria it also began with roses\", he said. His remarks sparked ire from a number of lawmakers who stormed out of parliament, while others applauded the prime minister.\\n\\nSyria\\'s war broke out in March 2011 after the brutal repression of nationwide anti-regime protests that demanded civil liberties and the release of political prisoners. It has since evolved into a complex conflict involving world powers, regional factions and jihadists that has left more than 360,000 people dead, according to a war monitor, and millions displaced.\\n\\nOuyahia told parliament peaceful protests are among the rights enshrined in the Algerian constitution but he warned against the possibility that outside forces he did not name could \"manipulate\" demonstrators.\\n\\nThe scale of the protests have taken many by surprise and since last Friday students and lawyers have also demonstrated against Bouteflika\\'s bid for a fifth term.\\n\\nOmnipresent military, one party rule\\n\\nFor years, many Algerians avoided involvement in politics or in demonstrations for fear of the omnipresent security services or due to disillusionment, considering the country has been run by the same group of veterans since the 1954-1962 independence war with France.\\n\\nBouteflika, who came to power in 1999, is credited with helping to bring about the end in 2002 of a decade-long civil war which pitted the government against Islamist militants and in which around 200,000 people were killed.\\n\\nBecause of the extreme brutality of that conflict, many Algerians have long tolerated a restrictive political system in return for peace and stability. But the new protests appear to have broken the taboo on public dissent.\\n\\nThe opposition is not seen as an alternative to Bouteflika\\'s National Liberation Front (FLN) as it weak and divided and faces high hurdles in mounting an electoral challenge. Since the FLN again picked Bouteflika as its presidential candidate, several parties, trade unions and business groups have endorsed him.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Hurled in anger and caught on a video that went viral, the insults included \"Dirty Zionist\" and \"France is ours\", quickly eliciting a wave of condemnation from across the political spectrum.\\n\\nFinkielkraut, 69, was harassed by dozens of people who gathered on a Paris street last weekend wearing the now-iconic neon yellow vests.\\n\\nA member of the prestigious Académie Française and the French-born son of Polish immigrants, Finkielkraut\\'s father survived deportation from France to Auschwitz during World War II.\\n\\nThe attack on a prominent member of France\\'s Jewish community quickly raised questions over whether the Yellow Vest movement is itself anti-Semitic -- or if it merely has some unsavoury undercurrents.\\n\\nThe three-month-old movement first grew out of anger over a proposed fuel-tax hike before morphing into a broader airing of economic grievances and discontent with President Emmanuel Macron\\'s administration, mainstream media and elites in general.\\n\\nBut the recent anti-Semitic overtones may well illustrate the limits of a protest movement that is deliberately leaderless, wilfully unstructured, self-consciously open to all comers - and yet impressive in its longevity, after 14 weeks of uninterrupted weekly revolts.\\n\\nAnti-Semitic acts on the rise\\n\\nThe Finkielkraut incident was the latest in a spate of anti-Semitic incidents across France. The marked rise in such acts - a 74 percent surge in anti-Jewish offences was recorded last year - predates the Yellow Vest protests, which began on November 17.\\n\\nStill, observers have noted the use of anti-Semitic slogans during some Yellow Vest demonstrations, including the words \"Macron [is the] Jews\\' Bitch\" painted on a central Paris garage door. Moreover, after Finkielkraut was harassed many French pundits took note of the slow, tepid or lack of response by the Yellow Vests\\' self-appointed principals, with the muted reaction taken to suggest complicity or at least tolerance.\\n\\n>> Read more: Why is France facing an upsurge in anti-Semitic attacks?\\n\\n\"We, unfortunately, cannot say that anti-Semitism is on the margins of the movement,\" French philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy told Europe 1 radio on Monday. \"It is the heart of the movement ... That doesn\\'t mean that the movement is intrinsically anti-Semitic, but it does mean that it is time for them to come forward strongly to say, \\'Not in our name,\\' not like they are doing now: \\'Yes, OK, but...\\' There are no buts.\"\\n\\n\"It would be false and absurd to say that the Yellow Vest movement is anti-Semitic,\" Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told L\\'Express magazine on Tuesday. \"I think, however - and this is more worrisome - that with the advent of the Yellow Vest crisis, a certain number of safeguards ... have fallen away. People call it a freeing of speech, but in truth it is much more than that. The prohibitions that create the conditions of a peaceful life in society have been called into question. And among those elements, there is anti-Semitism.\"\\n\\nThe premier went on to note that one of the cornerstones of the otherwise amorphous Yellow Vest movement is an anti-establishment stance that holds few things sacred.\\n\\n\"It touches on respect for symbols of the Republic, journalists, elected officials as well as churches, synagogues and cemeteries....\" Philippe said. \"Going after Alain Finkielkraut is precisely going after a symbol of the Republic -- the indispensable figure of the socially involved intellectual.\"\\n\\nThe nature of the movement - which remains all-encompassing and leaderless - also helps explain how anti-Jewish sentiment may be gaining a foothold. A self-styled ultra-democratic movement intentionally bereft of professionals could be particularly vulnerable to radical, organised interlopers looking to usurp the message.\\n\\n\"Anti-Semitic incidents among the Yellow Vests are a bit [built-in] to the movement because there are several political families who demonstrate within the Yellow Vests that exhibit anti-Semitic behaviour,\" Sylvain Boulouque, a historian and far-left specialist at Cergy-Pontoise University, told FRANCE 24.\\n\\nBoulouque cites the far left, the far right, Islamists and Salafists as those \"who might seem the most obvious, but which are fairly new within the Yellow Vest movement\". French media reported that one man identified as having insulted Finkielkraut in Saturday\\'s video is a Salafist, but that claim has not been confirmed. A sort of populist anti-Semitic vernacular can be found on the left and right alike, Boulouque noted.\\n\\nAnti-Semitic remarks \"can be heard in every demonstration\", said Boulouque. \"What\\'s happening now is that these are demonstrations that are definitely not organised, and the Yellow Vests do not monitor the protesters\\' remarks.\"\\n\\nOverwhelmed\\n\\nOne far-right specialist echoes that analysis. \"The Yellow Vests are not anti-Semitic as a movement. They began with societal demands,\" Jean-Yves Camus, author of \"Far-Right Politics in Europe\", told AFP on Monday.\\n\\n\"But it is a movement that wagered on ... an absence of leaders, of stewards [for rallies], and that put itself in a situation of very quickly seeing radical elements overwhelm the declarations of the media figureheads.\"\\n\\nCamus added that the Yellow Vests fell into a trap in the French capital, where they have protested - always disruptively - on 14 consecutive Saturdays. \"In Paris, it becomes a protest against the symbols of power and, naturally, the most radical elements are more seen.\"\\n\\nAnother reason for an increase in anti-Semitic elements among the Yellow Vests may simply be logistical: As the overall number of protesters diminishes, those remaining might be the hardest of the hardliners.\\n\\nThis coincides with the convictions of France\\'s intelligence community. Asked by Le Parisien newspaper on Tuesday whether the number of radical Yellow Vest demonstrators is on the rise, French intelligence chief Nicolas Lerner said: \"Proportionally, yes, because the number of demonstrators is falling.\"\\n\\nLerner, who heads the DGSI, the agency charged with France\\'s internal security, suggested that some of the most radical, violent elements appear to have inspired violent behaviour in fellow protesters who didn\\'t initially belong to radical movements.\\n\\nBut he noted, \"at no point did the extremist groups succeed in taking over the leadership of the movement, even if they see in it an opportunity to go after symbols of the Republic, which are their usual targets\".\\n\\n\\'Lightning rod\\'\\n\\nThe result, in the words of one editorialist, is that the protests have simply acted as \"a lightning rod\".\\n\\n\"After the Saturdays of violence that clouded the \\'Yellow Vest\\' message, their declining mobilisation has left more room for the pariahs of the Republic,\" Paul Caraci wrote Monday in Midi Libre, a regional newspaper. \"Anti-Semites, xenophobes and other extremist troublemakers have found here a screen to stain with their intolerable vomit.\"\\n\\nAnd while the Yellow Vest movement may not be anti-Semitic per se, its members might be more receptive to the types of ideas that can fuel anti-Semitism.\\n\\nA study released by the Ifop polling firm last week showed that people identifying as \"Yellow Vests\" are considerably more likely to espouse conspiracy theories than the general French population (41 percent vs. 21 percent). Ifop tested for beliefs in a wide spectrum of conspiracy theories, including \"some airplane contrails are composed of chemicals deliberately spread for secret reasons\" (29 percent vs. 15 percent); \"international drug trafficking is actually controlled by the CIA\" (35 percent vs. 19 percent); and \"the car accident in which Lady Diana died was in fact a covered-up assassination\" (57 percent vs. 34 percent).\\n\\nAsked whether \"a worldwide Zionist plot\" exists, 44 percent of Yellow Vest members surveyed agreed compared to 22 percent of French people generally, according to the study.\\n\\nThe Ifop report also draws a link between the Yellow Vests\\' receptiveness to conspiracy theories and their disproportionate distrust of traditional media. While 37 percent of French people use social media and video sites as their primary sources of news, the Ifop report found a full 59 percent of those identifying as Yellow Vests do so.\\n\\nA separate survey by the same pollster - released Monday but conducted before the Finkielkraut incident on Saturday - showed support for the Yellow Vest movement was down to 50 percent, a five-point drop in a single week and a new low since Ifop began asking the question in November. Only 11 percent of French people surveyed now identify as Yellow Vests themselves, down from 19 percent two months ago, amid weekend after weekend of protest violence.\\n\\nFinally, while just 31 percent of French people polled in early December thought the Yellow Vests needed to end their fight, 52 percent now believe they should call it quits.',\n",

The protesters aren\\'t buying rhetoric about stimulating the economy.\\n\\n\"We want climate change to be taken into account. Of course the economy is important and makes a country prosper. But to have a country, you need a planet. And if we destroy it, there won\\'t be an economy at all,\" said Zelia, a high schooler.\\n\\nUniversity student Luke Schilling wants action. \"The truth is, all the legal tools already exist,\" he says. \"What we want is for them to be applied concretely. It\\'s very nice to organise a One Planet Summit in France to show that we are leaders on the international stage, but if we don\\'t respect our own commitments, then what\\'s the point?\"\\n\\nIt\\'s the first significant showing from French students in the #FridaysForFuture movement that has taken off in recent weeks.\\n\\nThe larger movement began in August with Swedish 16-year-old Greta Thunberg\\'s weekly protests in front of her country\\'s parliament. She inspired tens of thousands of students in Sweden, Australia, Germany and in Belgium, among others.\\n\\nIn Brussels on January 24, 35,000 secondary school students marched on the European Parliament in the city\\'s biggest student demonstration in recent memory.\\n\\nFriday\\'s demonstration in Paris had a relatively modest turnout of 300 to 400 students, but they are getting organised quickly.\\n\\nStudents have pledged to join their peers around Europe in weekly demonstrations leading up to March 15, when Thunberg has called for a global strike.\\n\\nLouis Mallet, a science and environmental policy student at Jussieu and Sciences Po, is a member of Youth for Climate. The French branch of the global network is only a few weeks old, but the group is trying to organise efforts around the country so they present a united front and a coordinated message.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only just begun this past week.

We\\'ll call for all the local chapters to go on strike next Friday. [...] It should be massive. We\\'re building up to March 15.\"\\n\\nStudents have formed a working group to decide on a set of weekly demands.\\n\\nThis week there are several demands: declare \"a state of climate emergency\"; stick to France\\'s Paris Accord commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 4 percent per year; and rewrite the constitution to encode environmental protection and social solidarity in the country\\'s guiding text.\\n\\nThe plan for next week is to issue a new demand on Monday February 18, giving the government the week to respond before the next rally.\\n\\nCivil disobedience to protest government inaction\\n\\nThe working group formed by students from high schools and university student unions around the Paris area drew a direct link to the ongoing Yellow Vests protests.\\n\\n\"The Yellow Vest movement is demanding social justice, and it has made a power shift possible [...] We invite you to join the Yellow Vests every Sunday in their protests against this system that is ravaging the environment. Green Friday, Yellow Saturday...\"\\n\\nThe Yellow Vest demonstrations began as a protest against a hike in a fuel tax, but has transformed over the past few months into a movement for economic justice.\\n\\nStudents present on Friday weren\\'t ready to embrace all protest tactics. They are still trying to define their movement and the types of civil disobedience that will work best.\\n\\n\"We might do an unplanned protest. Maybe a peaceful roadblock,\" said Nathan, a high-school student. He and his green-bandana-clad friends had some red lines though: no vandalism or rioting.\\n\\nNour, another high schooler, is opposed to blockades. \"We want to work with the government. It\\'s our government. It\\'s not the people against the government. That won\\'t work.\"\\n\\n\"We really want to try to stay one hundred percent pacifist,\" said her friend Solveig. She had a stuffed polar bear on her shoulders holding a sign saying \"I want to live\".\\n\\nThe atmosphere at Friday\\'s rally was enthusiastic, hopeful and very calm.

       "    'title': \"Venezuela's Maduro orders 'total revision' of US ties after Pence comments\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Venezuela\\'s President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday accused Washington of ordering a coup against his government and called for a \"total revision\" of ties with the US.\\n\\nThe latest claims by Caracas of a US coup plot came the day before a mass street protest announced by the opposition, and one day after a mutiny by some soldiers.\\n\\nMaduro was specifically reacting to comments by US Vice President Mike Pence, who posted a video on Twitter branding Maduro \"a dictator with no legitimate claim to power.\"\\n\\nReferring to Wednesday\\'s planned opposition rally, Pence added: \"As the good people of Venezuela make your voices heard tomorrow, on behalf of the American people, we say: estamos con ustedes. We are with you.\"\\n\\nMaduro responded during a radio and TV broadcast that \"what the government of the United States did through Vice President Mike Pence, was to give orders to carry out a coup from the fascist state... which is unparalleled in the history of relations between the United States and Venezuela in 200 years.\"\\n\\nHe ordered Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza to begin \"a total revision of relations\" with Washington, which has already sanctioned top Venezuelan regime figures.\\n\\n\\'Reconsider the plan\\'\\n\\nWith Maduro\\'s government ominously predicting there would be violence against opposition protesters, US Senator Marco Rubio warned Venezuela\\'s intelligence service to \"reconsider the plan they have for tomorrow before it\\'s too late.\"\\n\\n\"You are about to cross a line & trigger a response that believe me you are not prepared to face,\" the Florida Republican said on Twitter.\\n\\nRubio urged prayers for \"the thousands of Venezuelans who will face danger & difficulty in the hours ahead. May God give them strength. And may he change the hearts of military leaders so that they protect not repress their fellow countrymen.\"\\n\\nThe Venezuelan government\\'s rhetoric intensified the day after a group of soldiers rose up against Maduro at a command post in the north of Caracas. They published a video on social media calling for the public to come out and support them.\\n\\nBut they surrendered after police and military units surrounded the post, and the 27 soldiers were arrested.\\n\\nTheir voices were heard, though, according to the non-governmental Social Conflict Observatory, which said on Tuesday that anti-Maduro protests were recorded in at least 30 different locations around the capital.\\n\\nThe Organization of American States, which has declared Maduro\\'s new term illegitimate, plans to hold an extraordinary session on Thursday to discuss \"recent events in Venezuela.\"\\n\\n\"Yankee go home! We won\\'t let them interfere in the affairs of the homeland,\" Maduro\\'s Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said in televised remarks, while Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez accused Pence of having ordered \"terrorists\" to carry out acts of violence during Wednesday\\'s protest.\\n\\n\\'It was awful\\'\\n\\nDemonstrators are set to mobilize behind the National Assembly\\'s new president Juan Guaido, who has branded Maduro a \"usurper\" and wants to establish a transitional government leading to elections.\\n\\nMaduro\\'s administration stripped the Assembly of its power but Guaido has risen to the challenge of taking him on. The movement has gained traction since Maduro was sworn in for a second term as president on January 10 after he won controversial elections.\\n\\nUnrest triggered by Monday\\'s troop uprising lasted in some places until Tuesday morning.\\n\\n\"Maduro out! That\\'s what the people were shouting. It was awful,\" 60-year-old Dinora de Longa told AFP.\\n\\n\"The police were shooting and there was tear gas everywhere. I had to put my grandchildren in the bathroom. This won\\'t solve anything.\"\\n\\nOne protest, in which people pelted cars with stones, took place on the motorway linking Caracas to the neighboring port of La Guaira, where the capital\\'s airport is located.\\n\\nThe opposition accuses Maduro of running an authoritarian regime and acting unconstitutionally.\\n\\nCounter demonstration\\n\\nWednesday\\'s protest date of January 23 is significant because it marks 61 years since the fall of Marcos Perez Jimenez\\'s dictatorship.\\n\\nThe regime has responded by announcing its own demonstration in support of Maduro.\\n\\nIt will be the first major street movement since 125 people were killed during civil unrest between April and July 2017.\\n\\nVenezuela is suffering the worst economic crisis in its modern history. Food and medicine have been in short supply, while spiraling inflation -- predicted to reach a mind-boggling 10 million percent this year -- has crippled the currency.\\n\\nThe crisis was sparked by a fall in global oil prices in 2014, a commodity Venezuela is almost entirely reliant upon. Its crude production has dropped to barely a third of the level of a decade ago.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Top 10 stories of 2018: Facebook in freefall, the Khashoggi affair and Brett Kavanaugh',\n",
       "    'body': 'Whistleblower Christopher Wylie, former director of research at political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, revealed in March that the firm had harvested personal data from millions of Facebook profiles without consent and used it for political targeting.\\n\\nFacebook then revealed earlier this year that a third-party personality quiz distributed on Facebook gathered profile information on 87 million users worldwide and then sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The revelations sparked outrage internationally and forced Facebook to announce a series of changes it would be making to restrict access to client data.\\n\\nMany now allege that the actions of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook may have been key to both the election of US President Donald Trump and the Brexit vote in 2016.\\n\\nIn the first significant move to punish the company for its actions, the attorney general for Washington, DC, said in December the US capital city had sued Facebook for allegedly misleading users about how it safeguarded their personal data.\\n\\nTHE BENALLA AFFAIR\\n\\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron became engulfed in a PR scandal when his then deputy chief of staff, Alexandre Benalla, 26, was found to have impersonated a policeman and roughed up protesters at a May Day rally.\\n\\nFootage of Benalla beating a young man on the ground and pulling a woman by the hair caused widespread shock, compounded when it was revealed that Macron had known about the incident and did not report Benalla to the authorities.\\n\\nThe controversy continued to spiral with Macron\\'s high-handed handling of the case. The Élysée Palace took weeks to officially fire Benalla, he was suspended without pay for two weeks - but was later found to have been paid - and the case never went to court.\\n\\nMacron, who critics have compared to the \"Sun King\" and who has acquired a reputation for arrogant aloofness, took six days to speak out over the affair. He shrugged off the case as \"a storm in a teacup\" and dared those who criticised his handling of the case to \"come and get him\".\\n\\nMeanwhile, the French media continued to reveal details of Benalla\\'s extensive access to the Élysée, the French parliament and the police.\\n\\nA more serious threat to Macron\\'s presidency\\'s came later in the year in the form of the \"Yellow Vest\" movement.\\n\\nBut the wedding was not without its critics. Dozens of homeless people were cleared from the streets of Windsor before the service while 1,200 members of the public invited to attend were told \"to bring your own picnic\", prompting comments they were just extras for the TV coverage.\\n\\nThe wedding was viewed by a record 18 million people in the UK and 29 million were reported to have viewed the service from the United States, up from the 23 million Americans who watched Prince William and Catherine Middleton\\'s nuptials.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex later announced they would be expecting their first child in the spring of 2019.\\n\\nBut analysts remain divided on the success of the summit, saying the statement the leaders signed was extremely vague, allowing for misinterpretation on both sides.No weapons inspectors have been allowed into North Korea and no weapons facilities have yet been destroyed.\\n\\nTHAI CAVE RESCUE\\n\\nTwelve members of the Wild Boars junior football team and their coach became trapped in Thailand\\'s sprawling Tham Luang cave network on June 23 when sudden, continuous rainfall blocked their exit. Nine days later on July 2, they were found by a team of British divers who had negotiated narrow passages, rising rainwaters and muddy currents in their bid to locate them.\\n\\nThe boys were healthy but stranded some 4 kilometres from the entrance, a journey of six hours against the current (and five hours with the current). Rescue options included teaching the boys to dive, finding or drilling another entrance, or waiting for the rainwaters to subside at the end of the monsoon season four months later.\\n\\nEventually the boys were \"swum out\" in an elaborate operation involving more than 100 divers. They were dressed in wetsuits and face masks, and anaesthetised so they didn\\'t panic. But the rescue was not without tragedy: Diver and former Navy Seal Saman Kunan, 37, lost consciousness after delivering supplies of air and could not be revived.\\n\\nOn July 10, just hours after the last child was carried out safely, the water pumps draining the area failed and the cave was suddenly flooded.\\n\\nKavanaugh emphatically denied the allegations. Democrats called for Kavanaugh to withdraw and said an FBI investigation was needed before a final confirmation vote in the Senate.\\n\\nAt a Senate judiciary committee hearing that was live-streamed on September 4 around the globe, Ford, who was emotional but composed, testified that she was \"100 percent certain\" it was Kavanaugh whohad assaulted her as a teenager- pinning her down on a bed, trying to remove her clothes and covering her mouth with his hand.\\n\\nKavanaugh hit back with heated testimony, insisting he was the victim of a \"grotesque and coordinated character assassination\". He said he would not be \"intimidated\" into withdrawing his candidacy, describing the confirmation process as a \"national disgrace\".\\n\\nThe hearing, coming on the heels of the #MeToo movement, was seen as a referendum on the political power of women in the United States. It bore strong echoes of the Anita Hill vs Thomas Clarence case some 27 years earlier.\\n\\nOn October 6, the Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh\\'s nomination, a key victory for Trump ahead of the November midterm elections.\\n\\nRelief efforts were hampered by severed communication and power lines. Medicines ran out and rescuers struggled with a shortage of heavy equipment to reach desperate victims calling out from the ruins of collapsed buildings.\\n\\nIndonesia is prone to earthquakes because of its location on the \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.\\n\\nA Boxing Day quake on December 2004 triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including 168,000 in Indonesia.\\n\\nTHE KHASHOGGI AFFAIR\\n\\nSaudi dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, 59, was murdered and dismembered inside the Saudi Arabia consulate in Istanbul on October 2. Khashoggi had gone to the embassy to collect documents for his upcoming marriage to his Turkish fiancée, who was waiting in vain for him outside.\\n\\nThe Saudis initially claimed that Khashoggi had left the embassy of his own accord. But a series of leaks from Turkish intelligence, which had bugged the embassy, revealed that Khashoggi had been tortured and dismembered with a bone saw by a 15-man hit squad that had flown in from Saudi Arabia that morning. After three weeks of denials, obfuscations and silence, the Saudis said Khashoggi died in a \"fistfight\". His body has still not been found.\\n\\nEvidence that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known by his initials MBS, had ordered the murder was soon overwhelming. TheCIA concluded that MBS had given the order for Khashoggi\\'s execution but Trump chose to disagree with the agency\\'s findings.\\n\\nHowever, the global outrage sparked by Khashoggi\\'s death left the oil-rich kingdom diplomatically weakened and tarnished the prince\\'s international reputation. The grisly slaying put Saudi human rights abuses in the spotlight, many investors shunned the kingdom\\'s \"Davos in the Desert\" forum, and the US Senate voted to end American military support for Riyadh\\'s military campaign in Yemen.\\n\\nKhashoggi was a prominent Saudi journalist, once enjoying close ties with Saudi royals, who had fled the country in late 2017 after falling foul of MBS. He settled in the United States, where he offered criticism of his country in a regular op-ed for the Washington Post.\\n\\nThe Democrats\\' campaign focused largely on healthcare, particularly on defending former president Barack Obama\\'s Affordable Care Act, while Republicans focused largely on taxes and immigration.\\n\\nThe protests, organised largely on Facebook, began with roadblocks across the country on consecutive Saturdays and soon spread to the French capital. On December 2, police were overrun by violent riots and central Paris saw its worst riots in the last five decades. Protests at dozens of schools over university reforms, and a call by farmers for demonstrations, led to a sense of general revolt.\\n\\nMacron had previously vowed to stay the course in his bid to shake up the French economy and not be swayed by mass protests that have forced previous presidents to back down. But he was forced to bow to protesters\\' demands and suspend the fuel tax rise due to come into force on January 1.\\n\\nHe did, however, rule out bringing back a wealth tax, one of the protesters\\' demands, cementing his reputation (for some) as a \"president of the rich\".\\n\\nTen people have so far died in incidents linked to the demonstrations, mostly in accidents at roadblocks set up by the protesters.',\n",

       "    'body': \"Prime Minister Edouard Philippe visited a motorcycle police unit involved in an incident Saturday near the glittering Champs-Elysees avenue in central Paris.\\n\\nIn the incident, during the sixth straight weekend of protests by the grassroots movement protesting high taxes and other economic problems, an officer pulled a gun after protesters kicked over his motorcycle. He did not fire it, but the move prompted a surge of anger by demonstrators hurling paving stones and other projectiles that drove the officer and his team to flee.\\n\\nOverall, the number of protesters Saturday was sharply down from previous weekends, and most actions were peaceful. But despite multiple concessions from President Emmanuel Macron, the movement isn't over and one group is calling for Christmas protests Monday and Tuesday on the Champs-Elysees, and others are planning action on New Year's Eve.\\n\\nMany protesters have denounced what they describe as disproportionate responses by police that include multiple beatings also captured on video. Hundreds of people have been injured in the clashes, mainly protesters but also police officers and journalists.\\n\\nPolice say they're acting in self-defense, and defended the officer who brandished his gun, saying it served as a deterrent to protect his colleagues.\\n\\nPolice investigating alleged anti-Semitic outbursts\\n\\nMeanwhile, Paris authorities are investigating alleged anti-Semitic comments by yellow vest protesters in the city subway toward a woman whose father died at Auschwitz.\\n\\nA journalist described on Twitter witnessing the incident Saturday night. The woman's nephew identified his aunt as the target of the comments.\\n\\nThe Paris prosecutor's office said Monday that an investigation has been opened into public insults based on race or religion and denying crimes of humanity.\\n\\nSome protesters in the yellow vest movement have expressed extreme or racist views. But research into its followers and their online comments has found that the movement as a whole is a broad-based grassroots phenomenon with no single political bent that includes people from many sectors of society.\\n\\nIt began with anger of a rise in taxes on gasoline and diesel, which is why the protesters wear the fluorescent emergency vests that all French motorists are required to carry in their vehicles.\",\n",

       "    'body': 'At least 5,000 demonstrators took to the streets of the Hungarian capital Budapest late Friday, as rightwing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban dismissed a wave of protests against a new labour reform as \"hysterical shouting\".\\n\\nProtesters marched from outside parliament to the presidential palace on the other side of the Danube in temperatures close to freezing.\\n\\nMany shouted angry slogans against the government but no clashes were reported with police.\\n\\nThe current series of protests was sparked on December 12 when MPs passed a measure -- dubbed the \"slave law\" by opponents -- which hikes the amount of overtime that employers can demand from 250 to 400 hours per year.\\n\\nFriday evening\\'s demonstration is expected to be the last before the Christmas holidays, but unions and opposition parties announced they would hold a new protest on 5 January to keep up the momentum of the movement into the new year.\\n\\n\\'New opposition\\'\\n\\nBalazs Barany from the leftwing MSZP party told the rally that \"a new opposition has been born\", with the protests uniting various rival factions in an unprecedented fashion.\\n\\nUnions have also taken part, threatening a general strike to fight the law.\\n\\nTamas Szucs from the teachers\\' union told the crowd: \"The country must be brought to a standstill in January!\"\\n\\nBalazs Lipusz from the Union of University Students added: \"If the workers stop the factories, block the roads, we will go with them!\"\\n\\nA rude anti-Orban slogan was projected onto the side of parliament and the presidential palace, with some protestors also chanting slogans in solidarity with the private Central European University (CEU).\\n\\nDuring the rally Anna Donath from the small liberal party Momentum read out a list of five demands of the protest movement, including not only the abolition of the overtime law, but also the scrapping of a recent judicial reform and more independence in public news media.\\n\\nMeanwhile, councils in Hungary\\'s third-largest city of Szeged and the northern town of Salgotarjan on Friday passed resolutions promising not to implement the new law.\\n\\n\\'Hysterical shouting\\'\\n\\nSpeaking at a press conference before Friday\\'s protest, MSZP president Bertalan Toth alluded to possible protest action against businesses with ties to Orban\\'s Fidesz party, as well as the big employers who stand to benefit from the overtime law.\\n\\n\"We will target those that the Fidesz regime caters to with their laws,\" Toth said.\\n\\nHowever, Orban used a weekly interview with public radio to double down on his defence of the law, saying that his government \"simply wants to get rid of silly rules so that those who want to earn more can work more\".\\n\\n>> Parliament initiates steps under Article 7 over Hungary\\'s \\'systemic threat\\' to EU values\\n\\nOrban said in the interview that employees will be paid for overtime at the end of each month, but the text of the law allows employers to delay payment by up to three years.\\n\\nOrban insisted that \"this law is a good law, we have to judge it on how it works in practice\".\\n\\n\"We heard this same hysterical shouting when we threw the IMF out of Hungary, when we cut taxes or introduced the public works programme, the opposition cried: \\'Slave!\\',\" he added.\\n\\nHe also repeated the government\\'s accusation that the \"most aggressive protesters are paid by George Soros,\" the liberal Hungarian-born US billionaire and a frequent target of Orban\\'s government.\\n\\nAccording to a poll published by the Publicus company on Friday, more than two-thirds of Hungarians thought the protests were justified and that the overtime law would hurt workers\\' interests.',\n",

       "    'title': \"'All smoke and mirrors': Yellow Vest protesters reject 'crumbs' offered by Macron\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Placating the disruptive protests that have rattled France was always going to be a hard sell for embattled President Emmanuel Macron. His long-awaited concessions on Monday left most protesters dissatisfied and the broader public on the fence.\\n\\nIn a solemn \"address to the nation\" on Monday, Macron sought to reassert control over a nation wracked by four weeks of increasingly violent protests over fuel costs and an array of other grievances. His pitch included immediate relief measures aimed at struggling workers and pensioners, along with a rare act of contrition from a president often criticised as being out of touch.\\n\\nWhether Macron\\'s compromises will turn public opinion against the protest movement remains to be seen. But at roadblocks across France, Yellow Vest activists responded with defiance on Monday night, variously describing the president\\'s concessions as \"a charade\", a \"bluff\" or \"a drop in the ocean\" - and vowing to press on with their protests.\\n\\nMany expressed dismay that a president so prone to delivering lengthy speeches on the virtues of globalisation and European integration should - after two weeks of deafening silence - spare a mere 13 minutes to address the worst domestic crisis of his presidency.\\n\\nConcessions, but no U-turn\\n\\nNamed after the neon safety jackets that are mandatory in all French vehicles, the so-called \"Gilets Jaunes\" (Yellow Vests) movement began as a protest against fuel tax increases and soon mushroomed into a wider revolt against stagnant wages and the high cost of living. Scattered and leaderless, it is strongest in neglected peripheral regions but has brought rallies - and rioting - to some of the poshest districts of Paris.\\n\\nMacron promised immediate steps to address the \"economic and social state of emergency\" highlighted by the protests. They included a state-funded €100 supplement to the minimum wage starting at the New Year along with the abolition of taxes on overtime pay - a measure previously introduced by former president Nicolas Sarkozy and then scrapped by his successor, François Hollande. Macron also pledged tocancel a tax hike on small pensions, acknowledging it was \"unjust\".\\n\\nBut the former investment banker showed no sign of relenting on the business- and investor-friendly economic policies that have earned him the label of \"president of the rich\".\\n\\nIn a plea that was widely mocked as wishful thinking, he asked profit-making businesses to grant workers year-end bonuses, adding that they would be tax-free. As was widely expected, Macron said he would not reintroduce the highly symbolic wealth tax he scrapped upon entering office - a move his critics routinely describe as the \"original sin\" that shattered France\\'s social contract.\\n\\n\"[The tax] existed for 40 years, but did we live any better as a result?\" the president asked, in a rhetorical question that many at Yellow Vest roadblocks answered with a resounding, \"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\'Provocation\\'\\n\\nBenjamin Cauchy, a spokesperson for one of the more moderate Yellow Vest groups, said Macron\\'s refusal to back down on the wealth tax was proof that \"he remains the president of the rich\". He described the announced measures as \"more of a budgetary adjustment than a change of political course\", adding: \"That doesn\\'t correspond to what the French want.\"\\n\\nAt a roundabout in the southern town of Le Boulou, where some 150 Yellow Vests had gathered around a loudspeaker to listen to the president, the general impression was that Macron was offering too little, too late.\\n\\n\"He is trying to do a pirouette to land back on his feet but we can see that he isn\\'t sincere, that it\\'s all smoke and mirrors,\" said Jean-Marc, a car mechanic, in remarks to AFP. \"It\\'s just window dressing, for the media, some trivial measures, it almost seems like a provocation,\" added Thierry, a 55-year-old bicycle mechanic, who resumed blocking traffic within minutes of the address.\\n\\nAt the other end of the country, in the northeastern town of Commercy, contempt for the president was palpable as protesters scoffed when Macron conceded he \"might have hurt people with [his] words\" - a reference to his numerous gaffes, culminating in his recent gibe at a jobless man that he need only \"cross the street\" to find a job.\\n\\n\"Monsieur feels bad,\" mocked Elisabeth, a 66-year-old retiree. \"It was about time,\" said Damien, in his thirties, while another woman shouted \"Liar!\" Jonathan, a 35-year-old local official, added: \"He is being held hostage so he drops some crumbs.\"\\n\\nSupport for protests slipping\\n\\nNot all protesters were unmoved by Macron\\'s overtures. In better news for the embattled president, Jacline Mouraud, one of the movement\\'s early figureheads, called for a pause in protests in an interview with French broadcaster LCI on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"The door is now open, we must seize the opportunity,\" said Mouraud, who was credited with igniting the protest movement with an October 18 social media post in which she accused the French president of \"hounding drivers\" with the fuel tax hike.\\n\\n\"We have to transform the movement into something else,\" she said. \"We cannot decently continue this way, with Christmas just days away, or else shopkeepers will go bust.\"\\n\\nWinning over some of the more moderate Yellow Vests may yet prove to be enough for Macron, who has enjoyed broad success in dividing and conqueringtrade unions when pushing through labour reforms. The 40-year-old president, whose popularity has plummeted in recent months, is keenly aware of the importance of public opinion in tackling protest movements. His performance on Monday - with 23 million viewers, a more popular draw than France\\'s winning World Cup final in July - went down better with the general public, according to early opinion polls.\\n\\nJust under half (49 percent) of people surveyed by the OpinionWay institute said they found Macron \"convincing\", with between 60 percent and 78 percent approving his measures when taken one by one.\\n\\nWhile 66 percent said they continued to support the Yellow Vest movement, more than half (54 percent) said they wanted the protests to end. According to another survey, by pollster Odoxa, the same percentage continues to support the roadblocks and other demonstrations - although this number has dropped from the 66 percent who expressed a similar opinion three weeks ago.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Even as it grapples with violent demonstrations over living costs, the French government is hunkering down for a \"Black Tuesday\" of protests by high-school students who have jumped onto the Yellow Vest bandwagon.\\n\\nEver since the May 1968 protests that paralysed France and precipitated the demise of its war hero Charles de Gaulle, French governments have been terrified by the prospect of facing a united front of workers and student protests. While French universities are largely quiet nowadays, the prospect of a two-pronged offensive edged nearer to reality last week when high-school pupils seized on the momentum from the so-called Yellow Vest movement to vent their anger at President Emmanuel Macron\\'s educational reforms.\\n\\nUp to 300 French high schools, known as lycées, were barricaded every day last week, amid scenes of vandalism, bins set on fire and violent clashes between police and students. The tense standoff made international headlines on Thursday when video footage posted on social media showed riot police in a Paris suburb forcing dozens of students to kneel down in rows, their hands on their heads.\\n\\n>> Read more: Outcry as French police round up protesting high-school students\\n\\nOn Monday, France\\'s education ministry said the number of affected schools had fallen to 120, only a third of which were fully blocked. But with student unions calling for a \"Black Tuesday\" in lycées across the country on December 11, the relative calm could prove to be merely a lull before the storm.\\n\\nHands off \\'le bac\\'\\n\\nHigh-school students have been angered by President Macron\\'s plans to change the end-of-school exam, known as the baccalaureate or \\'bac\\', and replace the broad subject areas pupils currently choose from - science, literature or social sciences - with more specific courses. They demand the repeal of a reform, passed last year, which introduces stricter selection criteria for university. Critics say the government\\'s moves breed inequality between rich schools and poorer, peripheral ones. They also oppose plans for a national civic service for French youths, due to be rolled out in 2026.\\n\\n\"We will continue protesting until our demands are met,\" Jules Spector, head of the FIDL union, told FRANCE 24. \"The government has made no gestures towards us,\" he added. \"On the contrary, it is obvious they are waiting for the end of term to slow down our movement.\"\\n\\nWorryingly for the Macron administration, there are tentative signs the unrest may also be spreading to universities, where students are angry at the government\\'s plans to hike fees for non-EU nationals in a bid to make French universities \"more competitive\". The Sorbonne shut its main campus in central Paris in anticipation of possible protests, while students in Nanterre and Rennes-2 - traditionally two of France\\'s most politicised universities - voted to blockade their facilities.\\n\\n\\'Children of the Yellow Vests\\'\\n\\nA major source of concern for France\\'s embattled government is the traditionally erratic and volatile nature of student protests - a potentially incendiary element at a time when Yellow Vest demonstrations have already erupted into violence in the streets of Paris and other cities. On top of their own demands, pupils in schools up and down the country have expressed solidarity with the Yellow Vest movement, which began as a protest against a tax-fuel hike but has mushroomed into a general revolt against stagnant wages and the high cost of living.\\n\\n\"If the student movement has taken hold it is in part thanks to the Yellow Vests,\" said Robi Morder, head of the GERME centre for the study of student movements at Sciences-Po Paris, in an interview with FRANCE 24.\\n\\nIn both cases, Morder noted, the protesters come largely from peripheral areas and small towns that are starved of public services and jobs, and feel abandoned by Parisian elites. Behind the students\\' specific demands, \"their discontent expresses a more deep-seated anxiety, about jobs in particular, and a fear of the future,\" he added. \"In this respect, [Education Minister] Jean-Michel Blanquer is wrong to claim there is no link between the students and the Yellow Vests. He does not understand that the students in the street are the children of the Yellow Vests.\"',\n",

People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting \"We Want Trump!\" Love France.\" His claim that protesters were chanting \\'We want Trump\\' has since been roundly debunked.\\n\\nTrump has previously spoken out about the Yellow Vest movement, saluting French protesters for agreeing \"with the conclusion I reached two years ago\" - namely that \"the Paris Agreement is fatally flawed\".\\n\\nWhile the Yellow Vest movement did spring up as a response to hiking fuel prices, it is not an anti-environmental movement. Saturday\\'s protest also saw a Climate March, which a number of Yellow Vests joined.\\n\\n\"Look at what policeman are doing to those who criticised our police!\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, Turkey\\'s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan denounced what he considered the \"disproportionate violence\" of the French authorities towards the protesters, adding that he was following the situation \"with concern\".\\n\\n\"Chaos reigns in the streets of many European countries, starting with Paris. Television channels and newspapers are full of photos of burning cars, looted shops and the most violent police crackdowns on protesters,\" he said.\\n\\nTurkey is \"against both the scenes of chaos brought about by protesters and the disproportionate violence that greeted them,\" he said in a speech in Istanbul.\\n\\nThe demonstrations were widely covered by Turkish media, which also repeatedly broadcast the video of high school students forced to kneel with their hands behind their heads by police officers in Mantes-la-Jolie, a western suburb of Paris. \"Ah! Look at what police officers are doing to those who criticised our police,\" said Erdogan. He also declared that Europe had \"failed in terms of democracy, human rights and freedom\".\\n\\nTurkey has come under fire from European countries and human rights bodies for human rights violations and the erosion of the rule of law in the country.',\n",

       "    'body': 'That\\'s not to say that the city won\\'t be safe - the police are deploying 89,000 security forces nationwide and about 8,000 forces and a dozen armoured vehicles in Paris to try to avoid anything like the destruction and mayhem that occured last weekend. Even then, the hotspots were largely avoidable. It\\'s just that, if you are a tourist, many of those hotspots are exactly where you will want to be.\\n\\nThe Champs-Élysées, for example, was the epicentre of last weekend\\'s chaos, so this is one to definitely avoid on this, the fourth weekend of protests - or Act IV, as its proponents are calling it. Stores on the famed thoroughfare have been told to keep their doors shut, protect their windows and remove outdoor furniture.\\n\\nMost of them will simply close, as will the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the Petit Palais, the Grand Palais, the Pompidou Centre and the Catacombs. Both the Garnier and Bastille opera houses have cancelled Saturday\\'s performances, as have other theatres, and six Ligue 1 football matches have been postponed, including that of Paris Saint-German versus Montpellier. Many other museums have not yet specified what action they will take, so check with your destination before you head out.\\n\\nHowever, the closures don\\'t have to mean that your weekend in Paris is ruined. Don\\'t forget there\\'s a Disneyland just a short train ride away. And they say you can get amazing deals on high-end brands at the La Vallée Village outlet centre - conveniently accessible by RER trains - and right now its Christmas decorations are up. Plus, getting your Christmas shopping done this early in the season is nothing to be sniffed at.\\n\\nUnmellow Yellows\\n\\nAll the safeguards are in place to prevent a repeat of last weekend when, in the worst rioting in central Paris since 1968, demonstrators torched cars, looted shops and defaced the Arc de Triomphe. As a result, hundreds of people were arrested.\\n\\nThe protests have taken place every weekend since November 17. They arose from opposition to a proposed tax on fuel but have since grown into a broad challenge to President Emmanuel Macron and his policies, which are widely seen here in France as favouring the rich. The protesters\\' name comes from the fluorescent-yellow safety vests all French motorists are required to keep in their cars.\\n\\nThis weekend, authorities are braced for \"significant violence\" as demonstrators from both the far right and the far left are expected to converge on the capital, and be joined by a fair number of hooligans just along for the tumultuous ride. Authorities believe the latter were responsible for the worst of the violence last weekend.\\n\\nSince the movement began, four people have died in the protests and hundreds of others have been injured.\\n\\nIf you must go out in Paris, avoid the trouble spots by keeping yourself informed of the protest route and giving it a wide berth. While the exact course is hard to predict, rallying points include the Champs-Élysées, Bastille, Denfert-Rochereau and the Eiffel Tower.\\n\\nGaffe-prone Macron\\n\\nFaced with the deepest crisis of his presidency so far, Macron, who has made repeated gaffes that paint him as out of touch with non-elites, has been surprisingly absent and largely intransigent in face of the unrest, though the government did say it would annul next year\\'s fuel tax hike. However Macron\\'s office also said he would stick to his decision to cut the wealth tax on high earners, which the Yellow Vests want rolled back.\\n\\nMembers of Macron\\'s government, though, have been more conciliatory. Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said he was open to adopting new measures to help low-paid workers. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was willing to accelerate tax cuts.\\n\\nDespite the violence, the demonstrators seem to represent the sentiment of the majority of French citizens. An opinion poll conducted this week showed that 72 percent of those surveyed backed the protests. And the movement has inspired others, including students demonstrating against proposed educational reforms. Nearly 280 high schools across the country were disrupted this week, with more than 700 students being detained by police, AFP reported. Some of the youth torched rubbish bins and tossed Molotov cocktails.\\n\\nIn addition, two truck driver unions are planning an indefinite strike to begin Sunday night, and farmers have called for demonstrations every day next week.',\n",

       "    'body': 'In the face of the \"Yellow Vests\" movement, French political parties find themselves walking a fine line: they need to be supportive of demonstrators without fully backing them, all the while keeping sight of their environmental goals.\\n\\nIn response to a tax hike on already rising diesel prices, outraged French people, hailing predominantly from rural areas, are planning a nationwide protest on November 17. Clad in the movement\\'s signature \"Yellow Vests\", they plan to block roads all over the country. The demonstrations are expected to be massive: more than 850,000 people signed a petition supporting the Yellow Vests and there are hundreds of pages on Facebook calling on people to join the blockade\\n\\nThe tax hike is part of France\\'s long-term ecological plan and is meant to move the country\\'s citizens away from fossil fuels in general and, in particular, from diesel cars. Opponents say that the tax is unjust and unfairly penalises those living in non-urban areas, where there is little access to public transportation.\\n\\nThe campaign poses a conundrum for opposition parties. How do they demonstrate solidarity with voters without looking like they are exploiting a movement that has deemed itself apolitical? And without contradicting their past positions on the environment?\\n\\nThe difficulty of that balancing act is evident in the stance taken by almost all of the opposition parties, most of which \"support the movement but not the blockades\". Here is a breakdown of each party\\'s position, from the extreme right to the far left.\\n\\nNational Rally (Rassemblement National)\\n\\nNational Rally (or RN, which was formerly known as the National Front) President Marine Le Pen was one of the first politicians to show support for the Yellow Vest movement. In late-October she began calling for her party\\'s officials and representatives to join the protest, and party activists have been distributing leaflets for the movement. Le Pen, however, will refrain from joining the rallies herself. She justified her stance in a radio interview with France Inter: \"The place of a party leader is not at demonstrations.\" That position allows her to denounce the attempts of her political rivals to capitalise on the movement.\\n\\nAlthough \"a good part of the elected RN\" are expected to participate in the road blockages, according to Wallerand de Saint-Just, the RN\\'s regional councilor for the Ile-de-France region, activists and party officials have been asked not to wear party logos, so that the movement isn\\'t equated with the far right. But Le Pen is already being accused of taking advantage of it.\\n\\n\"The November 17 demonstration is being completely exploited by Marine Le Pen and [Stand Up the Republic leader] Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, who are hugely irresponsible on this subject,\" said government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux.\\n\\nStand Up The Republic (Debout la France)\\n\\nNicolas Dupont-Aignan, the president of Stand Up The Republic and a former ally of Marine Le Pen, didn\\'t hesitate to say that he would take part. It was an activist from his movement who helped spread word of the mobilisation by posting a video on his Facebook page that went viral and has now been viewed by more than 4.4 million people.\\n\\n\"Someone, I don\\'t know who, launched on Facebook the idea of a general mobilisation of the French people, saying that on November 17 we should all block the country\\'s main roads to protest the rise in the price of gasoline ... I suggest you all contact your friends and go block your city, the ring roads, motorway tolls ... Please share this video widely,\" activist Frank Buhler wrote on October 23. A former member of Le Pen\\'s National Rally, Buhler is in the process of being expelled from that party for making racist remarks on Twitter.\\n\\nThe Republicans (Les Républicains)\\n\\nOn November 17, Laurent Wauquiez will likely trade his ever-present red parka for an equally becoming yellow vest. The president of The Republicans (LR) plans to join a demonstration in his department, the Haute-Loire.\\n\\n\"The position of LR is simple: we will be on the side of angry demonstrators but we won\\'t call for the blocade because it is counterproductive,\" the party\\'s vice president, Guillaume Peltier, explained in the free newspaper 20 Minutes.\\n\\nAlong with LR MP Damien Abad, Peltier proposed in early November distributing a \"fuel cheque\" of €100 to 13 million rural French who have \"no access to public transport\". The proposal is intended to offset the \"excessive rise in taxes\" on diesel. Never mind that the proposal comes with an exorbitant price tag and isn\\'t really in line with the limits on public spending traditionally defended by the right. The measure is far from unanimously supported by the party.\\n\\nThe Socialist Party (Parti Socialiste)\\n\\nThere is no easy position for the Socialist Party, which, since its poor performance in the last presidential election, continues its plummet without managing to reconnect with voters. \"We support the French who are mobilising to defend their purchasing power,\" said party boss Olivier Faure.\\n\\nThe government has linked the grassroots movement with the RN \"to better disqualify it\", Faure said, no doubt anxious not to contradict the environmental positioning of his party. The Socialists have not officially called for protests, even if some party leaders will be on the street. It is, to say the least, paradoxical for a party that created the carbon tax to support a demonstration against rising fuel prices.\\n\\nThe former socialist presidential candidate and now leader of Generation.s, Benoît Hamon, for his part, believes that there is \"legitimate political anger\". But that isn\\'t enough to get him to join the movement. \"I\\'m not going to protest next to the FN,\" he said.\\n\\nFrance Unbowed (La France Insoumise)\\n\\nFrance Unbowed (LFI) faces the same conundrum. Between the ecological positions of the party and its fear of seeing the Yellow Vests movement claimed by the hard and extreme right, the party has had a hard time positioning itself.\\n\\nFormer presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon, without calling on members to participate in the blockade, wished the movement success. \"I\\'m told \\'there are [fascists] in there.\\' Yes, yes, there are everywhere, and there are also a lot of angry people who are not [fascists], and they are right to be angry,\" he said at a meeting on November 8. \"This anger is just, it is about something that makes sense.\"\\n\\nSome LFI officials, such as François Ruffin, will participate as individuals. \"I\\'ll go there to listen, to understand,\" the popular deputy said on France Inter.\\n\\nSeine-Saint-Denis deputy Clémentine Autain, on the other hand, will not take part. She refuses to \"parade at the call of [far-right publication] Minute and with Marine Le Pen,\" she explained in Le Monde on November 6.',\n",

Police trucks were deployed but there were no reports of clashes between security forces and crowds that packed downtown Algiers.\\n\\n\"We stay here until the whole system goes,\" said Mahmoud Timar, a 37-year-old teacher.\\n\\nBouteflika, 82 and rarely seen in public since suffering a stroke [in 2013], bowed to the protesters last week by reversing plans to stand in elections for a fifth term and promising reforms to make the political system more inclusive.\\n\\nBut he stopped short of quitting and said he would stay on until a new constitution is adopted, effectively extending his present term. The move further enraged Algerians, and many of Bouteflika\\'s allies turned against him.\\n\\n\"We are close to victory. The system is divided,\" said restaurant owner Rachid Zemmir, 55, at Friday\\'s rally.\\n\\n>> From peacemaker to recluse: Bouteflika\\'s two decades at the helm\\n\\nBouteflika has a track record of consolidating power by outmanoeuvring anyone seen as a threat. First elected president in 1999, he wrested power from the secretive military-based establishment known as \"le pouvoir\" (the power).\\n\\nIn 2015, Bouteflika sacked powerful intelligence chief Mohamed Mediene, dubbed \"Algeria\\'s God\". Last year he dismissed about a dozen top military officers.\\n\\nIn the most significant development in a month of demonstrations, Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Ahmed Gaed Salah threw the army\\'s weight behind the protesters on Wednesday, saying they had expressed \"noble aims\".\\n\\nThat was a major setback for Bouteflika, who bolstered his position over the years with the help of the army and oligarchs who funded his election campaigns.\\n\\n\"The people and the army are brothers,\" protesters chanted on Friday.\\n\\nSoldiers have stayed in their barracks through the unrest.\\n\\nThe generals have intervened in the past at momentous times, including cancelling an election which Islamists were poised to win in 1992, triggering a civil war in which an estimated 200,000 people were killed.\\n\\nSome members of the ruling National Liberation Front party, known by its French acronym FLN, have also sided with the protesters.

       "    'body': 'Bashir\\'s three-decade rule has been rocked by two months of protests that a deadly crackdown has failed to suppress. On Friday, he imposed a nationwide state of emergency and dissolved the federal and provincial governments.\\n\\nIn a televised speech to the nation, the veteran leader pledged to form a government of technocrats to address Sudan\\'s chronic economic woes, which have been the driving force behind the protests.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Bashir sacked his vice president and long-time ally Bakri Hassan Saleh, replacing him with Defence Minister General Awad Ibnouf.\\n\\nIn a separate decree, he appointed Mohamed Tahir Ela, former governor of the agricultural state of Gezira, as prime minister.\\n\\nBut protest organisers and their supporters in the political opposition dismissed the reshuffles.\\n\\nThey said the state of emergency showed that Bashir\\'s rule was weakened and only its overthrow would now satisfy the protesters.\\n\\n\"Imposing a state of emergency shows the fear within the regime,\" the Alliance for Freedom and Change said.\\n\\n\"We will continue with our people to take to the streets across all towns and villages until our demand has been achieved.\"\\n\\nThe National Umma Party, whose leader Sadiq al-Mahdi was Sudan\\'s elected prime minister when Bashir seized power in an Islamist-backed coup in 1989, said the protests against his successor\\'s iron-fisted rule would carry on until he quits.\\n\\n\"Dissolving the government and imposing a state of emergency is nothing but a repetition of this regime\\'s failures,\" it said.\\n\\n\"Nothing will satisfy the people who are taking to the streets except the overthrow of this regime.\"\\n\\nRecovery now \\'less likely\\'\\n\\nAnalysts said the state of emergency was an act of desperation in the face of public anger.\\n\\n\"The declaration of emergency powers only makes it less likely that the economy can be revived,\" said Eric Reeves, a senior fellow at Harvard University, who has tracked Sudan\\'s politics and economy for two decades.\\n\\n\"The regime has never understood economics...that\\'s why there are in the mess they are.\"\\n\\nSudan has been hit by a chronic shortage of hard currency to pay for imports that has worsened since South Sudan became independent in 2011, taking with it the bulk of oil earnings.\\n\\nThe resulting shortages in basic goods have fuelled spiralling inflation that has devastated the purchasing power and living standards of ordinary Sudanese from agricultural labourers to middle-class professionals.\\n\\nThe immediate trigger for the demonstrations was a government decision last December to triple the price of bread.\\n\\nBut the demonstrations swiftly mushroomed as they fed into wider grievances and the Sudanese Professionals Association -- an umbrella group of teachers, doctors and engineer -- has taken the lead in using social media to organise daily protests.\\n\\nIt was only afterwards that the political opposition joined in, forming an alliance with the SPA.\\n\\n\"The imposing of emergency unfortunately suggests that things will get worse before they get better,\" said Murithi Mutiga of the International Crisis Group think-tank.\\n\\n\"It concentrates powers in Bashir\\'s hands and sets the stage for a confrontation with the protest movement, which may become more violent than it has been.\"\\n\\n\\'Editor detained\\'\\n\\nHuman Rights Watch says at least 51 people have been killed, while Sudanese officials say 31 people have died in protest-related violence since the demonstrations began on December 19.\\n\\nHundreds of protesters, opposition leaders, activists and journalists have been jailed in a crackdown led by the feared National Intelligence and Security Service.\\n\\nAnd the crackdown shows no sign of easing.\\n\\nSoon after he imposed the emergency, prominent newspaper editor Osman Mirghani was detained by security agents for comments he made in a television interview criticising the move.\\n\\nBashir told Sudanese he understood the scale of the economic crisis facing the country.\\n\\n\"The economic issue needs to be tackled by qualified people and for this I will form a government made of people of quality,\" he said.\\n\\nThe protest alliance, which also includes the political wings of rebel groups in Sudan\\'s three domestic war zones, has united around a platform that promises radical reforms, including an end to huge military spending on the conflicts.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Historic French police rape verdict comes as sexual violence complaints rise',\n",
       "    'body': 'The coincidence of the two pieces of good news for women\\'s rights proponents and victims\\' rights advocates in France is, to be clear, fortuitous. The Interior Ministry\\'s crime statistics are released annually. The guilty verdict in the Emily Spanton case was five years\\' in the making, stretching back to the night in April 2014 when the then 34-year-old was gang-raped inside Paris\\'s prestigious judicial police headquarters by officers she met at a nearby pub.\\n\\nBut to hear one victims\\' rights advocate tell it, they are instructive -- two sides of the same coin in a country where attitudes towards sexual violence victims and the victims\\' own attitudes towards seeking justice are both changing with the times.\\n\\nLower \\'threshhold of tolerance\\' for sexual violence\\n\\nThe Interior Ministry\\'s criminal statistics report, released Thursday, indicated the number of sexual violence complaints made to authorities \"rose sharply\" in 2018, up 19 percent, accentuating a trend. Rape complaints leapt by 17 percent and sexual assault complaints by 20 percent last year, the report said. It argued that victims\\' attitudes towards filing a complaint evolved \"in the climate of the Weinstein Affair and the different social media movements encouraging victims to speak out\". Only one in 10 people identifying as a victim of sexual violence outside the home took the step of filing a complaint in 2016, it said, but that proportion tripled for incidents that took place in 2017.\\n\\n\"The higher number of victims of sexual violence registered in 2017 and later in 2018 likely follows at once from an increased disclosure of occurrences and of a lowering of the threshold of tolerance of this type of violence in a context where [law enforcement] has sought to improve how they receive victims and to develop alternative means for them to provide statements,\" the ministry said.\\n\\nWomen\\'s rights activists hailed the report\\'s findings. France\\'s #MeToo-inspired feminist collective #NousToutes tweeted, \"+17% rape complaints in 2018. It\\'s a sign that society is changing. Public policy must follow.\"\\n\\n\\'End of an era\\'\\n\\nEconomist Sandrine Rousseau, who heads Parler, an association that supports and accompanies sexually assaulted women through the legal process, believes #MeToo did play a role in the rising figures. But she says the metamorphosis happening is deeper and goes back further in time. While cautioning that eight of 10 women today still never do file a complaint, Rousseau says \"I think we don\\'t realise just how much women no longer want to be subjected to this. I think that, truly, it\\'s the end of an era,\" the former Europe Écologie-les Verts party executive told FRANCE 24.\\n\\nRousseau similarly sees a heartening leap forward in the Spanton verdict, which she calls historic, at once in its conviction of elite figures and in the failure of the defence\\'s antiquated strategy. The two police officers - members of an elite unit who were based in the prestigious judicial headquarters known by its famous address, 36, Quai des Orfèvres, synonymous in France with popular crime fiction - were sentenced to seven years in prison for raping Spanton, despite efforts to call her credibility as victim into question. (The two police officers, jailed after the verdict was read on Thursday, denied wrongdoing and filed appeals to overturn their convictions on Friday.)\\n\\n\"For me, it\\'s an important verdict because it was a trial that functioned a little bit old-school, that is the rapists\\' defence was to say \\'she drank, she had several lovers\\' and picking apart her life,\" says Rousseau. Spanton saw her past drug use and sexual history put on public display, even enduring the testimony of an ex-husband she reportedly hadn\\'t seen in 10 years, beamed into the courtroom by videoconference. But the assistant public prosecutor wasn\\'t having it, Rousseau suggests, instead choosing to focus on the policemen\\'s lack of concern over whether the victim was giving consent and their modus operandi on the night of the crime. That emphasis, Rousseau says, counts as progress in France.\\n\\n\\'Tipping point\\'\\n\\n\"Trials were inversed, where those called into question were the women who had spoken up. And that\\'s really typical of what is called rape culture,\" says Rousseau. \"And I think that is at a tipping point. This is the first sign that it is tipping in the courts.\"\\n\\nRousseau, for her part, got involved with sexual violence victim advocacy after she and other women accused a fellow ecology party executive, who was deputy speaker of the French lower house of parliament, of sexual misconduct, sparking a high-profile scandal.\\n\\n\"Another thing [that makes the Spanton trial historic] is that, in France, no one well-known or in a bit of a situation of power has ever been convicted of sexual violence. It doesn\\'t exist,\" Rousseau says, calling police officers from such an elite squad \"not just anybody\". \"It\\'s not that it\\'s very rare, it\\'s the first time,\" she says. \"We were living in the Middle Ages in France in terms of justice for sexual violence! We were back in the witch trials. And with this, I think we are entering another era.\"\\n\\nThe victims\\' rights advocate suggests that the odds are so stacked against a woman who files a rape complaint in France - with a woman effectively presumed to be consenting and needing to prove otherwise, submitting to such taxing rituals as a face-to-face \"confrontation\" with their alleged attackers - that the fact Spanton was a foreigner may have been a factor in this case reaching the conclusion it did.\\n\\nA foreigner leading the way?\\n\\n\"It might be because she is Canadian that she succeeded in making it to the end of this trial,\" Rousseau wonders of Spanton. \"I think she might not have imagined what she was getting herself into,\" the advocate says, in seeking to bring Spanton\\'s attackers to justice. The fact that Spanton, as the daughter of a Toronto police officer, was less daunted by the world of law enforcement than another victim might have been may also have played a role, she agrees.\\n\\nSo what are victims of sexual violence, perhaps hesitating over whether to file a complaint or stay mum, apt to draw from the Spanton case? The painful picking apart of the Canadian tourist\\'s life at trial or the historic verdict that saw her vindicated?\\n\\n\"The victims are so afraid that I don\\'t know what they retain,\" Rousseau concedes. \"But in any case, we\\'ll cross our fingers that that is what they retain.\"\\n\\nBut she applauds Spanton for seeing a \"very difficult, very traumatising\" process through, even with the appeals process now pending. \"I thank her, speaking as a victim, too, because I tell myself that it is because there are people who hold on right to the end that we are going to make it someday.\"',\n",

       "    'body': 'Multiple protests are being held around Paris and other cities, the 11th straight weekend of action prompted by Macron policies seen as favoring the rich.\\n\\nMacron has sapped some support for the movement by taking an active role in recent days in a national debate in towns across France, launched to address the protesters\\' concerns.\\n\\nSome yellow vest leaders are trying to keep up momentum by holding protests after dark as well as during the day. A small crowd of protesters advanced peacefully Saturday morning down the Champs-Elysees, site of recent rioting. Two other groups plan evening events across town, at Place de la Republique in eastern Paris.\\n\\nFrance deployed about 80,000 police Saturday against protest violence. About the same number of protesters took to the streets the last two weekends.\\n\\n\\'We are forgotten\\'\\n\\nParticipants at the Champs-Elysees march called Macron\\'s national debate a \"smoke screen\" to distract the French from his pro-business policies. They expressed views veering from the far left to a middle-ground, middle-class malaise. Many want Macron to restore France\\'s wealth tax and allow the public to propose national referendums on anything from pulling France out of the euro to rewriting the constitution.\\n\\n\"We are forgotten,\" said protester Mervyn Ramsamy, a hospital employee from north of Paris lamenting recent closures of maternity wards and other medical services in already struggling areas. \"We won\\'t give up.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s unclear how long the movement can maintain its momentum. Macron scrapped the fuel tax hike that initially sparked the protests and offered widespread tax relief when the protest violence hit a peak in December.\\n\\nA 52-year-old home care worker who identified herself only as Nicole says the measures aren\\'t enough, so she\\'s still protesting. \"I have a salary of 1,200 euros. I don\\'t run out of money by the 15th of the month, I run out of money by the 6th of the month. I can no longer manage to survive. That\\'s why I\\'m here, because nothing is moving, nothing is changing,\" she said on the Champs-Elysees.\\n\\nOne branch of the movement launched a bid this week for the European Parliament elections in May, but other protest leaders disagree with the idea.\\n\\nIn another challenge for the yellow vest movement, rival groups calling themselves the \"red scarves\" plan demonstrations Sunday to condemn violence unleashed by recent protests.\\n\\nPolice armed with guns firing non-lethal rubber balls - which have seriously injured several - are equipped with body cameras Saturday for the first time, in an experiment to record use of the weapons, providing context and eventual evidence if needed.\\n\\nIn between the Saturday protests, yellow-vested crowds occupy scattered roundabouts and tollbooths around France, disrupting traffic to express a sense of neglect by the central government. The movement began Nov. 17, named after the fluorescent garments French motorists must carry in case of emergency.',\n",

Discontent now appears to be more widespread and the ranks of security forces and government-allied groups have been thinned by the mass exodus of mostly young Venezuelans, he said.\\n\\n\"The government is resorting to its old tricks, but the people no longer believe them,\" Pantoulas said.',\n",

       "    'body': 'French women on Sunday marched in Paris to reclaim the \"yellow vest\" movement from violent activists, a day after protesters smashed their way into a government ministry.\\n\\nThe women, wearing yellow vests, turned out after 50,000 people returned to the streets of France on Saturday amid violent clashes with police.\\n\\nSome of the women waved yellow balloons and pushed prams. Protests were also held in other French cities.\\n\\n\"All the media ever reports is the violence, and we are forgetting the root of the problem\" which is the fight against austerity, said one protester, Karen, a 42-year-old nurse from Marseille.\\n\\nThe women sang the \"Marseillaise\", France\\'s national anthem, as they gathered on the steps of the city\\'s opera house at Bastille before marching through nearby streets.\\n\\nThe women\\'s demonstrations came as Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire called for an end to the \"yellow vest\" unrest, saying \"those who believe in democracy\" should now say \"that\\'s enough\", he told Europe 1 radio.\\n\\nThere were also women\\'s demonstrations in Caen, northwestern France, and Montceau-les-Mines, central-eastern France. In the southwestern city of Toulouse, 300 women took to the streets shouting: \"Macron your goose is cooked, the chicks are in the street.\"\\n\\nThe \"yellow vest\" protest movement, which has now seen protests on eight consecutive Saturdays, was initially triggered by anger over an increase in fuel taxes.\\n\\nBut it has since morphed into a campaign against the high cost of living and the government of President Emmanuel Macron, seen by many as arrogant and beholden to big business.\\n\\nGovernment spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, who is also a minister, on Saturday had to flee his offices by a backdoor when a handful of protesters smashed down the large wooden door into his ministry compound with the help of a forklift truck.\\n\\nHe later denounced the break-in, in which some cars were damaged and windows smashed, as an \"unacceptable attack on the Republic\".\\n\\nGriveaux had earlier criticised the yellow vest movement, describing those involved as \"agitators\" who sought \"to overthrow the government\".\\n\\nThe yellow vest protests have turned into the biggest political crisis of Macron\\'s 20-month presidency and brought his popularity ratings to an all-time low.\\n\\nHe initially refused to make any concessions, but in mid-December, after weeks of violence, he scrapped the planned fuel tax hike and promised extra cash for minimum wage earners as well as tax cuts for pensioners.\\n\\nAlthough public anger appeared to abate over the holiday period, the brief arrest on Wednesday of Eric Drouet, one of the leaders of the movement, seems to have rekindled resentment among his supporters.\\n\\nThe latest opinion poll, published on Thursday by Odoxa Dentsu, indicated 55 percent support the protests a figure which, although lower than the 75 percent back in November, is still important enough to suggest the anti-austerity movement retains political clout.\\n\\nMeanwhile, former cinema icon Brigitte Bardot, who is known today for her rightwing views and animal rights activism, on Sunday said she understood what motivated the yellow vest movement.\\n\\n\"When I see the millions spent on incredibly trivial things, when I see politicians using private planes and chauffeur-driven cars to get around (...) all this money spent is unacceptable,\" she told the Midi Libre newspaper.',\n",

Thanks to friendly neighbours we were able to put out the fires,\" ambassador Veronika Wand-Danielsson tweeted on Saturday, attaching photographs to her post.\\n\\nAuthorities have blamed the worst of the violence in recent weeks on anarchists, anti-capitalists and extreme groups on the fringes of the yellow vest movement.\\n\\nThe protests come 18 months into Macron\\'s tenure and his drive to reshape the economy, and have already forced him into concessions.\\n\\nLast month, Macron promised tax cuts for pensioners, wage rises for the poorest workers and the scrapping of planned fuel tax increases, at a cost to the Treasury of 10 billion euros.\\n\\nIt was the first big U-turn for a president elected 18 months earlier on a platform to break with traditional French politics and liberalise the heavily regulated economy.\\n\\nIn a New Year\\'s Eve address, Macron vowed to press on with his reform agenda, saying: \"We can\\'t work less, earn more, cut taxes and increase spending.\"\\n\\nFaced with record low popularity ratings, Macron is expected soon to set out his plans for the coming months. These include a nationwide debate on ecological, fiscal and institutional questions, the results of which he says will feed into policy.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Anti-government protests in Hungary hit the country\\'s public broadcaster on Monday, with the opposition galvanised by the furious reaction to a controversial new labour law.\\n\\nSeveral thousand demonstrators gathered in the evening outside the Budapest offices of the MTVA broadcaster after two opposition MPs broadcast footage of themselves being thrown out of the building earlier in the day.\\n\\nOne of the lawmakers had called for people to gather under the slogan: \"If they throw us out the door, we\\'ll come back in through the window\".\\n\\nThe MPs had demanded access to the studios to read out a petition against the government and what they call its \"slave\" labour law.\\n\\nMTVA security guards forcibly ejected independent MPs Akos Hadhazy and Bernadett Szel. The two MPs filed a complaint with police posted in front of the building and said as MPs they had a right to enter a public establishment.\\n\\n\"This is not a private television station for Fidesz,\" the party of rightwing nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, \"but the television of the Hungarian people, financed by the people\\'s taxes,\" said the MPs, who streamed the altercation live on Facebook.\\n\\nAn anti-government protest on Sunday evening drew 15,000 people.\\n\\nThe petition the lawmakers wanted to broadcast includes a demand to overturn the labour law - which has stirred protests by relaxing restrictions on overtime and by providing for delayed payments.\\n\\nA third MP was taken to hospital on Monday after another altercation with security at the building.\\n\\nThe rallies were the latest in a wave of protests that has seen opposition parties join forces against Orban\\'s nationalist government.\\n\\nThe new legislation has triggered days of protests -- backed by the opposition -- since it was adopted on Wednesday.\\n\\nDemonstrators have clashed with police over the law, which they say undermines workers\\' rights.\\n\\nThe opposition petition also demanded the annulment of another controversial law adopted on the same day, which paves the way for new \"administrative courts\" to oversee cases concerning matters such as public procurement or electoral disputes.\\n\\nJustice Minister Laszlo Trocsanyi, a close Orban ally, will oversee the courts. That prompted opposition warnings the premier could have near-total political influence over the judicial system.\\n\\nThe petition also calls for more independence and objectivity in public media outlets and also demands that Hungary join an EU public prosecutor\\'s office, a move the government has rejected.\\n\\nAfter the TV station refused to broadcast the petition on Sunday evening, some protesters threw smoke bombs at police, who responded with tear gas.\\n\\nAround 10 MPs from various opposition parties stayed within the MTVA building for much of Monday, pressing staff to read out the petition.\\n\\nThey later left the building at the police\\'s request, emerging to cheers from protestors.\\n\\nOne of those who was inside the building, MEP Peter Niedermueller from the liberal DK party, said the protest aimed was at \"restoring the freedom of the press\".\\n\\n\"It\\'s ridiculous that the majority of the country doesn\\'t even know what\\'s happening in Budapest because public TV, on all its channels, is only talking about preparations for Christmas,\" he said.\\n\\n\"Today we are not just fighting the two controversial laws but the whole of the Orban regime,\" ex-Prime Minister and DK leader Ferenc Gyurscany told the private Klubradio station.\\n\\nOpposition unity\\n\\nApart from the opposiotion, unions have also backed the demonstrations against the reforms, which hike the annual overtime hours that employers can demand from 250 to 400 hours and allow payment to be delayed by up to three years.\\n\\nTamas Szekely from Hungary\\'s main confederation of trade unions told the rally on Monday that they would organise a general strike if the reforms are signed into law.\\n\\nThe government says the changes are needed by employers short of manpower and will benefit those wanting to work extra hours.\\n\\nOver the weekend protestors also gathered in other parts of the country. In the third-biggest city Szeged, the socialist mayor called on businesses not to comply with the new overtime law.',\n",

       "    'body': 'French President Emmanuel Macron appealed to rival political leaders as well as trade unions to help tamp down the anti-government anger that on Saturday led to some of the worst rioting in central Paris in decades, according to government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux.\\n\\n\"The moment that we are living through is not about political opposition, it\\'s about the republic,\" Griveaux said after a cabinet meeting.\\n\\nThe head of the upper house of parliament, Gerard Larcher, also sounded the alarm about the insurrectional nature of the \"yellow vest\" protests which began on November 17.\\n\\n\"The republic is under threat,\" Larcher told France Inter radio. \"I\\'m not seeking to be dramatic. I want everyone to understand their responsibilities.\"\\n\\nHe referred to the sight of Arc de Triomphe -- a national symbol -- being vandalised by rioters who ran amok through Paris, torching cars and smashing shop windows.\\n\\nThe protests began on November 17 in opposition to rising fuel taxes, but they have since ballooned into a broad challenge to Macron\\'s pro-business agenda and style of governing.\\n\\nFar-right leader Marine Le Pen and hard-left firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon, who lost out to Macron in elections last year, have been vocal in backing the demonstrators\\' demands.\\n\\nThe 40-year-old centrist president was heckled Tuesday as he visited a burned-out government building in central France, hours after a new opinion poll showed his approval rating at just 23 percent.\\n\\nHe is yet to comment publicly since returning to France from a G20 summit in Argentina on Sunday morning.\\n\\nToo slow?\\n\\nA frequent demand from the protesters, who are mostly from rural and small-town France, is a repeal of his move last year to cut a \"fortune tax\" previously levied on high-earners.\\n\\nGriveaux indicated it might be repealed, once an evaluation of its effects had been completed in 2019.\\n\\n\"If something isn\\'t working, we\\'re not dumb, we\\'ll change it,\" he told RTL radio.\\n\\nMacron made scrapping the \"fortune tax\" a key campaign pledge ahead of his election in May 2017, arguing that such levies on the wealthy discouraged investment and drove entrepreneurs to leave France.\\n\\nGriveaux stressed that reinstating the tax \"is not on the table for now\", but Equality Minister Marlene Schiappa said she would argue to bring it back unless the tax cut was shown to be effective.\\n\\n\"The government has been too technocratic and took too long to respond\" to the protests, she told France 3 television.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced the first major retreat of Macron\\'s presidency when he suspended for six months a rise in fuel taxes scheduled for January 1.\\n\\nHe also froze increases in regulated electricity and gas prices and new vehicle norms which would have hit users of old, polluting diesel cars -- a battery of announcements targeted at low-income families.\\n\\nA source in the prime minister\\'s office told AFP that \"the government has not necessarily played all of its cards\", with more concessions possible such as a further cut in residence taxes.\\n\\nBut experts say the government has reacted too late to the street protests, a regular feature of French political life which have repeatedly forced Macron\\'s predecessors into U-turns.\\n\\n\"When you leave things to fester too long, it costs more,\" Jean-Francois Amadieu, a sociologist at Paris 1 university, told AFP.\\n\\nRaymond Soubie, another expert on French protest groups, said that \"the biggest question is whether public opinion continues to support the yellow vests\".\\n\\nA poll on Tuesday found 71 percent backed for the movement, but the same proportion believed the protests should stop if the government backed down on fuel tax hikes.\\n\\nFarmer protests\\n\\nMany \"yellow vest\" protesters, named after the high-visibility jackets they wear, said Philippe\\'s rollback was not enough and have called for new protests this Saturday.\\n\\nInterior Minister Christophe Castaner urged \"responsible\" protesters not to come to the capital.\\n\\nOpposition leaders, including Laurent Wauquiez of the rightwing Republicans, have called on the government to impose a state of emergency and to deploy army units to back up the police.\\n\\nAdding to the image of a country in revolt, the main French farmers union said Wednesday that its members would hold demonstrations every day next week.\\n\\nTwo truck driver unions have also called an indefinite sympathy strike from Sunday night, and students are blocking dozens of schools nationwide to denounce tougher university entrance requirements.',\n",

Cars, buildings and some cafés were torched.\\n\\nOver the past two days, ambulance drivers and students have joined in and launched their own protests.\\n\\nTwo unions, CGT and FO, called lorry drivers to start a strike from December 9 while several Facebook pages were also urging new rounds of demonstrations for next Saturday.\\n\\nAfter three weeks of rising frustration, there was little sign Philippe\\'s measures would placate the \"yellow vests\".\\n\\n\"The French don\\'t want crumbs, they want a baguette,\" \\'yellow vest\\' spokesman Benjamin Cauchy told French news channel BFM, adding that the movement called for a cancellation of the taxes.\\n\\nAnother protester, Christophe Chalencon, was more blunt: \"We\\'re being taken for idiots,\" he told Reuters, using a stronger expletive.\\n\\n\"I would say that 99 percent of the \\'yellow vests\\' who spoke on French media yesterday were saying that this is definitely not enough, that whatever the prime minister announced on Tuesday, he could have gone a lot further,\" said FRANCE 24 French Affairs Editor Philip Turle.\\n\\n\"There was one word that really ruined it all for the protesters, and that was \\'postponement\\',\" Turle continued. \"I think that\\'s where the protesters feel they have been ridiculed by Macron. So they\\'re saying: we\\'re not going to take our yellow vests off, we\\'re going to leave them on, because in six months we\\'re going to be coming back again.\"\\n\\n\"At best, Philippe\\'s announcement is a temporary fix for one of the questions that the movement\\'s about,\" added Oliver Davis, a professor of French politics at the University of Warwick, in an interview with FRANCE 24. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be enough to stem the protests.\"\\n\\nLe Pen, Trump chip in\\n\\nMacron came to office in mid-2017 promising to overhaul the economy, revitalise growth and draw foreign investment by making the nation a more attractive place to do business.\\n\\nFor the self-declared \"Jupiterian\" president, who is sharply down in the polls and struggling to regain the initiative, a further risk is how opposition parties leverage the anger and the decision to shift course.\\n\\nAhead of European Parliament elections next May, support for the far-right under Marine Le Pen and the far-left of Jean-Luc Mélenchon has been rising. Macron has cast those elections as a battle between his \"progressive\" ideas and what he sees as their promotion of nationalist or anti-EU agendas.\\n\\nLe Pen was quick to point out that the six-month postponement of the fuel-tax increases took the decision beyond the European elections.\\n\\nShe was not the only right-wing populist to take a swipe at Macron over the \\'yellow vest\\' protesters.\\n\\n\"I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protesters in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago,\" US President Donald Trump tweeted late on Tuesday.\\n\\n\"The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters,\" said Trump, referring to a global deal on the environment drafted in Paris in late 2015. Macron\\'s proposed fuel tax hikes are aimed at encouraging motorists to switch from petrol and diesel cars to more ecologically-friendly alternatives.',\n",

Here\\'s a look at where things now stand.\\n\\nWhat is the government\\'s position?\\n\\nFrench Prime Minister Édouard Philippe refused on Wednesday to give into mounting pressure to abandon the tax hike, which is due to come into effect on January 1, 2019.\\n\\n\"We have set a course and we will stay the course,\" he told French RMC radio and BFM television. \"A tax increase was planned to take effect January 1 of every year.

Macron\\'s concessions failed to impress the movement\\'s leaders, who swiftly called for fresh protests on the famous Champs-Élysées Avenue in Paris on Saturday.\\n\\n\"People feel like their opinion doesn\\'t count, that\\'s the message that\\'s being sent,\" said Priscilla Ludosky, one of two Yellow Vest representatives who met with Ecology Minister François de Rugy on Tuesday.\\n\\nLast weekend, the Champs-Élysées was the scene of violent clashes between protesters and police, who used teargas and a water-cannon to disperse crowds. The interior ministry estimated 106,000 people took part in demonstrations across the country, with 8,000 in Paris alone.\\n\\nOverwhelming support. According to a poll published by OpinionWay on Wednesday, 66 percent of respondents said they backed the Yellow Vest protests, while 78 percent said Macron\\'s proposals to help defray the rising cost of fuel were \"insufficient\".\\n\\nA survey published last week by opinion research firm Ifop reached similar results, with 66 percent of those questioned stating they had a \"favourable view\" of the movement.\\n\\nThe movement has also taken hold in France\\'s overseas territories. Life on the tiny Indian Ocean island of Réunion has been nearly paralysed by the protests, which have forced some schools and businesses to close.\\n\\nOverseas Territories Minister Annick Girardin arrived in Réunion on Wednesday, where she met for over an hour with Yellow Vest protesters angry over the high cost of living and widespread unemployment, which has reached 24 percent on the island.',\n",

       "    'title': \"'End of the world' vs. 'end of the month': Macron walks tightrope amid fuel tax protests  - France 24\",\n",
       "    'body': 'Emmanuel Macron\\'s highly anticipated speech on transitioning his country\\'s energy mix was always going to be a delicate balancing act. But in striking a conciliatory tone, the French president hardly appears to have enchanted anyone.\\n\\nThe French leader is walking a tightrope between keeping his showy pledge to \"Make Our Planet Great Again\", making good on his country\\'s Paris Climate Agreement leadership, and calming the self-styled \"Yellow Vests\", an amorphous movement that argues that Macron\\'s eco-minded fuel-tax hikes punish working-class consumers outside urban centres first and foremost.\\n\\nIn an hour-long speech short on detail but long on expressions of compassion, Macron returned again and again to the grievances expressed on roundabouts across the country, telling the \"Yellow Vest\" protesters (or the peaceful ones, at least): \"I have heard your anger.\" The French president declined to back down on the disputed fuel-tax hikes, but vowed to adapt a tax that, he conceded, is \"a bit blind\" to market price fluctuations in order to limit the impact on heavy drivers with little choice.\\n\\nThe Yellow Vest movement is into its 11th day of sometimes fiery protests. Two people have died in accidents during that span, with hundreds more injured. Violent and destructive clashes between police and demonstrators clad in high-visibility vests disfigured Paris\\'s storied Champs Élysées at the weekend. Police deployed clouds of teargas as barricades were set alight and luxury shopfronts smashed - an inauspicious start to the lucrative Christmas shopping season on the famed avenue.\\n\\n\\'End of the world\\' vs. \\'End of the month\\'\\n\\n\"What I want to make French people understand - notably those who say \\'we hear the president, the government, they talk about the end of the world and we are talking about the end of the month\\' - is that we are going to treat both, that we must treat both,\" Macron said during Tuesday\\'s televised address from the Élysée Palace.\\n\\nThe transition to more environmentally friendly resources has to happen, he said, not least for France\\'s own sovereignty in the face of fossil fuel providers like Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran. But, Macron said, \"This transition should not happen at any cost.\"\\n\\nThe 40-year-old centrist acknowledged that solutions made available to attenuate home and vehicle energy costs and upgrades are \"not concrete enough, not tangible enough, not simple enough\", and as a result aren\\'t used by the people most in need.\\n\\nHe pledged to put €7 to €8 billion towards supporting renewable energies every year, up from the current €5 billion budget.\\n\\nMacron also invited \"representatives of the Yellow Vests\" to propose solutions themselves during local consultations on the transition to cleaner energy over the next three months.\\n\\nNuclear \\'pragmatism\\'\\n\\nAnother closely watched element of this address - meant to set out a working framework for French energy policy for years to come - were decisions on the country\\'s reliance on nuclear power and its ageing stable of nuclear reactors. France has 58 reactors, second only to the US worldwide. The sector represents 220,000 jobs in France.\\n\\nMacron announced that France would reduce the share of nuclear in its power production from 75 percent to 50 percent by 2035 - not 2025, the initial target that Macron stressed was unrealistic. He said 14 of the reactors would be closed by 2035, including four to six before 2030, in an apparent compromise between the targets favoured by the French environment and economy ministers respectively. Only two reactors are slated for previously announced shutdowns during Macron\\'s current term of office. He left any decision on whether France would seek to build new, next-generation EPR reactors until at least 2021.\\n\\nMacron called his nuclear plan \"a pragmatic approach... that takes into account the security of supply\", saying France shouldn\\'t shut down plants only to have to import power from other countries with production less clean than can be produced domestically.\\n\\nAnd he touted nuclear\\'s ostensible advantages. \"Nuclear allows us to benefit from energy that is pared of carbon emissions and is low cost,\" Macron said. The president forbade EDF, the French electrical utility, from shutting any nuclear sites outright, saying his responsibility was to reduce, not end, France\\'s reliance on nuclear. Economic and social consequences for locals in the vicinity of the reactors poised to close should be limited, he said.\\n\\n\\'Total submission\\'\\n\\nReaction to Macron\\'s hotly awaited speech came fast and, largely, furious. Political rivals and environmental figures alike piled on. Leftists slammed Macron\\'s lack of focus on salaries and buying power, while conservatives accused the president of playing for time with disingenuous consultation. Many, meanwhile, blasted his plan to keep France hooked on nuclear power.\\n\\n\"The closure of the nuclear plants postponed for a month of Sundays, lies about the supposed advantages of that dangerous energy, stubbornness over the industrial and financial catastrophe that is the EPR reactor. Macron proves his total submission to the nuclear lobby,\" far-left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon charged after the speech.\\n\\nOn the far-right, Marine Le Pen for her part responded, \"To those asking how to balance their budgets three days from now, Macron replies see you in three months\". The National Rally leader said the \"absolute emptiness in terms of solutions [is] striking\".\\n\\nSocialist Party leader Olivier Faure slammed Macron for ignoring a swathe of Yellow Vest grievances: \"It isn\\'t just the issue of fuels, but the problem of purchasing power. And on that point, the president stayed mute, absolutely mute.\"\\n\\n\"Macron continues with the policy of grand speech and tiny steps,\" Yannick Jadot, from the green Europe Ecologie - Les Verts party, tweeted after the speech. \"He is closing us into bankrupt nuclear. One doesn\\'t extinguish anger with beautiful words without acts of social justice. One doesn\\'t prepare the future with energy from the old world.\"\\n\\nGreenpeace similarly slammed Macron\\'s persistence on nuclear power. \"Macron told us he wanted to change the method, but it is the substance that needs changing. France persists in presenting nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, when actually it is neither clean, nor inexpensive, and does in no way guarantee our energy independence,\" Greenpeace France chief Jean-François Julliard said in a statement. \"We wanted historic and structuring measures to fight climate change. The response is not equal to the emergency.\"\\n\\nWhat was notably scarce in the immediate critiques of Macron\\'s address were the usual charges levied against him - particularly by the demonstrators in yellow - that Macron acts like a \"president of the rich\" alone and decrees policy from on high, king-like. The lambasted leader may take these omissions as a small victory.\\n\\nIt remains to be seen how the Yellow Vests themselves will react to Macron\\'s purported empathy for their cause. After the president\\'s speech, the Élysée Palace announced that Macron invited his environment minister to meet with members of the Yellow Vest movement later Tuesday. Will the invitation to pitch solutions during a three-month consultation placate the protesters? Or is the Yellow Vest movement, the leadership of which is disputed and its sundry demands multifarious, bound to be unsatisfied with the drawn-out process?\\n\\n\"There are going to be consultations, with what? With whom? Yellow Vests who are elected by who? I didn\\'t vote for them, I don\\'t know them,\" Amaury, a 46-year-old jobseeker building a protest base camp in the middle of a Breton roundabout, told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday. \"I didn\\'t even listen to Macron. I don\\'t want to hear him. I don\\'t trust him anymore. He need only come here, out in the field.\"faure-greenpeace',\n",

Protests were banned around the Champs-Elysees, scene of recent rioting.\\n\\nAudrey Bayart, who came from northern France for the protest, said Legay\\'s case shows the government\\'s contempt toward protesters, especially after Macron told a newspaper the elderly woman should have had the \"wisdom\" not to join the Nice protest.\\n\\n\"After a while, you have to respect people and not tell them \\'you are fragile and you stay at home\\' ...

The opposition PDP said it was leading the ruling APC when the last vote was cancelled.\\n\\nJournalists and observers at polling units in Gama were attacked by the armed men, an AFP reporter saw, with police saving at least one journalist from assault.\\n\\nThe acting chairman of the PDP in Kano, Rabiu Suleiman Bichi on Saturday called on INEC to cancel the elections.\\n\\n\"As I address you now, we have reports that some of our agents have been killed, vehicles burnt, property destroyed,\" he said.\\n\\n- \\'Democracy in trouble\\' -\\n\\nThe director for the Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD), Idayat Hassan, condemned Saturday\\'s violence in these key wards. The violence would \"raise questions of the legitimacy\" of the results, she said.\\n\\n\"Journalists and observers have been intimidated\" because of a \"win at all costs mentality\" from politicians, she said. \"Democracy is in trouble in Nigeria.\"\\n\\nThe original elections a fortnight ago were declared invalid in some areas by Nigeria\\'s electoral board because of violence and disruption.\\n\\nTension was high in states such as Kano, where the result was finely balanced heading into today\\'s poll between the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).\\n\\nThe decision by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to void March 9 elections in six states came two weeks after President Muhammadu Buhari won a second term. His main rival Atiku Abubakar denounced the results as \"a sham\".\\n\\nINEC said violence and other irregularities had prompted voting to be cancelled in some areas of Kano and Sokoto, in the northwest; Bauchi and Adamawa in the northwest; and the central states of Benue and Plateau.\\n\\nA legal challenge, however, meant that the planned election in Adamawa did not go ahead Saturday, leaving five states to vote in the re-run.\\n\\n- Disputed elections -\\n\\nPolitical tensions have frayed in Nigeria since Buhari\\'s re-election. Abubakar, the defeated PDP candidate, has challenged the result in an election tribunal, claiming that the results in several states were manipulated.\\n\\nElection observers, citing reports of vote buying and intimidation, have criticised the organisation and running of the governorship and state elections, as well as the February 23 presidential and parliamentary polls.\\n\\nSituation Room, an umbrella group of more than 70 civil society organisations monitoring the vote, has called for an independent inquiry into the entire election process.\\n\\nThe opposition PDP denounced INEC\\'s decision to halt voting in affected states, claiming it was \"clearly leading the (governorship) race,\" accusing INEC of collusion with the ruling party.\\n\\nRegional elections are fiercely contested in Nigeria, where governors are powerful and influential figures, controlling state finances and responsible for key areas from education to health.\\n\\nBuhari will hope to consolidate his re-election victory whilst the opposition PDP seeks to claw back power at the state level.\\n\\nA seventh poll, in Rivers state, is to be run next month.

       "    'body': 'Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on Monday again defied mass protests calling for his immediate resignation, insisting on a plan to elect a successor only after a national conference and new constitution is approved.\\n\\nBouteflika, 82, last week bowed to demonstrators who say he is unfit to run Algeria by announcing he had reversed a decision to stand for another term. But he stopped short of stepping down and postponed elections due in April, in effect extending his current term until a new constitution can be prepared.\\n\\nIn a letter reported by Ennahar television, the veteran leader repeated an earlier plan for a national conference to reform the political system, which would be held shortly.\\n\\nThe forum will take \"decisive decisions\", state television quoted him as saying. A new constitution will then pave the way for a new president, the private Ennahar station added.\\n\\nThe scenario broadly reflects a timetable for change that Bouteflika mapped out on March 11.\\n\\nThe ailing leader has ruled for two decades but has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke five years ago.\\n\\nDemonstrators say Bouteflika is in no state of health to run the country, and they want to see a new generation of leadership tackle deep-seated economic problems and corruption.\\n\\nHis comments were published shortly after the chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Ahmed Gaed Salah, said the army should take responsibility for finding a quick solution to its political crisis, in the most overt signal of potential military intervention since demonstrations erupted three weeks ago.\\n\\nSo far, the powerful army has remained in barracks during the demonstrations, with the security forces mainly monitoring mostly peaceful demonstrations in Algiers and other cities.\\n\\n\"The army will remain a fortified fortress for the country,\" Salah said on state TV. \"We should be responsible for finding solutions as soon as possible. There is no problem without solution.\"\\n\\nHe added: \"I\\'m confident the Algerian people are wise and able to overcome all difficulties.\"\\n\\nThe army has generally wielded power in Algeria behind the scenes, but has intervened publicly during pivotal moments. In the early 1990s, generals cancelled elections which an Islamist party was set to win, triggering almost a decade of civil war that killed some 200,000 people.\\n\\nNo let up\\n\\nBouteflika\\'s concessions last week have brought no halt to the demonstrations, which are expected to continue on Tuesday, Algeria\\'s Independence Day holiday. On Monday, doctors called for mass protests during the celebrations.\\n\\nIn a statement, the independent Collective of Algerian Medical Residents (CAMRA) urged medical students to take part and denounce the \"ruling gangs\".\\n\\nProtesters are desperate for a new generation of leaders who can tackle the country\\'s pressing problems: a stagnant economy and high unemployment despite vast oil and gas resources.\\n\\nIn another concession, the Ministry of Religious Affairs on Sunday informed clerics that they are no longer required to submit texts of their sermons to authorities for approval. One of the most influential clerics in Algiers expressed his opposition to the government last week.\\n\\nSince returning from medical treatment in Switzerland last week, Bouteflika has been losing allies, including senior members of the ruling National Liberation Front party, known by its French acronym FLN.\\n\\nBouteflika named a new prime minister last week, but on Monday leaders of 13 independent Algerian labour unions refused to support his efforts to form a cabinet.\\n\\n\"We will not hold discussions with this system, we belong to the people and the people said \\'No\\' to the system,\" Boualem Amora, a leader of an education union, told reporters.\\n\\nNewly-appointed Deputy Prime Minister Ramtane Lamamra is expected to start a tour on Tuesday of some of Algeria\\'s main allies abroad to explain the new political roadmap, said a foreign ministry official. The tour will start on Tuesday with a visit to Moscow, Algeria\\'s most important military ally.\\n\\nIt will also include EU countries and China, which has invested billions of dollars in Algeria.',\n",

       "    'body': 'Demonstrations in France, sit-ins near the Eiffel Tower and a flashmob at Charles de Gaulle airport: the Yellow Vests are organising a weekend of new types of protest for their act 17 to try to combat falling numbers.\\n\\nThis comes before what protestors are calling the Ultimatum on March 16, to mark the end of President Emmanuel Macron\\'s three months of \\'Great National Debate\\'.\\n\\nAfter almost four months of weekly protests, the anti-government movement has been facing a slow decline for several Saturdays. For act 16, 39,300 demonstrators had been registered in France by the Ministry of the Interior, including 4,000 in Paris.\\n\\nThe numbers were down slightly from the previous Saturday, when 46,600 protesters took to the streets across France, including 5,800 in the capital. In general, the numbers have been steadily declining from the 282,000 peak at the start of the Yellow Vests protests last November. To counter this waning turnout, protestors have devised original new ways to make their dissent known.\\n\\n\"Decisive act: we will not move\" is the name for the main event of the weekend in Paris. The protestors are holding a three-day sit-in on the Champ de Mars, the park in front of the Eiffel Tower. Demonstrations are also planned in Lyon, Besançon, Strasbourg, Lille, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Avignon, Quimper or Le Puy-en-Velay.\\n\\nAs early as Friday evening, some 30 demonstrators tried to set up a few structures near the Eiffel Tower, but were quickly dislodged by the police, an AFP journalist noted.\\n\\n\"Without the announcement of real measures, we will stay on site all weekend and beyond if necessary,\" says the event\\'s Facebook page, which has 1,400 participants registered on Facebook and 6,600 \"interested\".\\n\\nThis occupation of the Champ de Mars was largely relayed by prominent leaders of the movement. \"The 8,9,10, big sit-in, big mobilization\", Maxime Nicolle promised in a video on Thursday. \"We\\'ll sleep on the spot.\"\\n\\nThe Parisian sit-in must \"set up our roundabouts in the heart of the capital, where we will be visible to everyone and get our message across\", explained another high-profile Yellow Vest member Priscillia Ludosky at a press conference last week.\\n\\nAct 17 has also taken inspiration from International Women\\'s Day. On Saturday, the Yellow Vest women are calling for a demonstration in Paris, starting at 11:00 am between the Champs-Elysées and Luxembourg Park. Objective: to \"bring all mobilisations together\".\\n\\nA \"giant flashmob\" at terminal 1 of Paris\\'s Roissy airport has also been announced at midday to protest against Aéroports de Paris\\' privatisation project.\\n\\nFor the Yellow Vests, the stated objective for March is to revive the spirit of the beginning of the movement.\\n\\nScheduled for March 16, Act 18 of the movement will take place the day after the official end of the Great National Debate and hopes to bring together \"the whole of France in Paris\" to issue an \"ultimatum\" to the government.',\n",

       "    'title': \"Denmark has 'pervasive rape culture' despite reputation for gender equality, says Amnesty \",\n",
       "    'body': 'Even though Denmark rates highly for gender equality in many areas of life, the Scandinavian country has \"a pervasive rape culture and there is endemic impunity for rapists\", according to a new report by Amnesty International.\\n\\nDenmark\\'s international reputation is as a progressive land of contented citizens. It came second only to Sweden in the 2017 Gender Equality Index, which examines a range of policy areas such as work, money and health. It has even won accolades both for happiness and as one of the world\\'s greatest countries for women. But Amnesty International\\'s worrying report paints a dramatically different picture when it comes to sexual violence.\\n\\n\"Despite Denmark\\'s image as a land of gender equality, the reality for women is starkly different, with shockingly high levels of impunity for sexual violence,\" said Amnesty International\\'s Secretary General Kumi Naidoo.\\n\\nThe problem begins with the radically different estimates for the number of women raped in Denmark every year. Official figures from the Danish Ministry of Justice state that around 5,100 women are subjected to rape or attempted rape every year. However, according to the Amnesty report, researchers at the University of Southern Denmark said it could be as high as 24,000 in 2017. And, in that year itself, only 890 rapes were reported to authorities, 535 of which led to prosecutions. Only 94 ended in convictions.\\n\\nAmnesty says that the differences are because rape in Denmark is often not reported and cases that do go through the justice system rarely result in convictions. This is in large part a result of the process for reporting rape, during which victims are often \"met with dismissive attitudes, victim blaming, and prejudice influenced by gender stereotypes and rape myths,\" the report said.\\n\\nAmend the definition of rape\\n\\n\"The simple truth is that sex without consent is rape,\" said Naidoo. \"Failure to recognise this in law leaves women exposed to sexual violence and fuels a dangerous culture of victim blaming and impunity reinforced by myths and stereotypes which pervade Danish society: from playground to locker room, police station to witness stand.\"\\n\\nAmnesty recommends that the government focus on amending the definition of rape and train police officers and lawyers so that they do not accidentally re-victimise women during the reporting process. Survivors told Amnesty that the fear of not being believed or even being blamed and shamed by police and justice officials were among the primary reasons for not reporting rape.\\n\\nGiven Denmark\\'s international reputation for equality, how has this rape culture persisted and become so severe?\\n\\n\"I believe that the perception that Denmark has achieved gender equality obscures the picture not only for the authorities but also for the general population. Discussions about issues such as persistent \"rape culture\" are often dismissed for this reason. There is little recognition of the scale and root causes of the problem,\" said Anna Blus, Western Europe and Women\\'s Rights Researcher with Amnesty, in an interview with FRANCE 24.\\n\\n\"This picture of widespread sexual violence and impunity for perpetrators stands in stark contrast with the image of Denmark as a country where gender equality has been achieved. And, as our report shows, rape survivors encounter rape myths and gender stereotypes at different stages of the legal process and many do not report to the police fearing they would be met with prejudice and victim blaming.\"\\n\\nKirstine, a 39-year-old journalist, said that she tried four times to file a report of rape with the police. On her second attempt, she was taken to a police cell and warned that she could go to prison if she was lying. She described how the reporting process meant \"enduring new fear, shame and humiliation\" and told Amnesty: \"If I was 20-years-old, I wouldn\\'t have proceeded after the first attempt.\"\\n\\n\\'I was just a young girl \\'claiming\\' to have been raped\\'\\n\\nAnother woman told Amnesty how intimidated she felt going to the police: \"I was just one 21-year-old woman, sitting there with two guys looking at me, saying, \\'are you sure you want to report this?\\'...I was just a young girl \\'claiming\\' to have been raped.\"\\n\\nBlus says this is starting to change now, as women\\'s rights organisations have been raising this issue and activism led by rape survivors is strong and growing.\\n\\nCurrently, the Danish Criminal Code defines rape on the basis of physical violence or threat thereof, the presence of duress, or the victim\\'s inability to resist the act. Victims interviewed by Amnesty stressed how important it was to them that the definition of rape in Danish law is changed to a consent-based one.\\n\\n\"Only 8 out of 31 European countries analysed by Amnesty International have consent-based legislation in place,\" said Naidoo. \"By amending its antiquated laws and ending the insidious culture of victim blaming and negative stereotyping, Denmark has an opportunity to join the tide of change that is sweeping Europe.\"\\n\\nThe law\\'s focus on resistance and violence rather than on consent has an impact not only on the reporting of rape but also on social awareness of sexual violence, both of which are key aspects of overcoming impunity for these crimes and preventing them from happening. Hanne Baden Nielsen from the Centre for Victims of Sexual Assault at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen said: \"Now, a man can say: \\'she did not say \\'no\\'.\\' But the question should be whether she said \\'yes\\'. There must be a mindset change.\"',\n",

       "    'title': \"From peacemaker to ailing recluse: Bouteflika's two decades at helm of Algeria\",\n",
       "    'body': 'President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a veteran of Algeria\\'s independence struggle who has ruled the North African country for two decades, is facing a wave of protests by crowds angry at his plans to seek a fifth term in office.\\n\\nA political survivor, Bouteflika is widely credited with helping to end a crippling civil war - pitting the army against Islamist insurgents - that killed some 200,000 people in the 1990s. But the 82-year-old has been largely out of sight since he suffered a stroke in 2013 that confined him to a wheelchair and severely impaired his speech. And his decision to stand for a fifth term in office has unleashed major protests in a country struggling with economic and political stagnation.\\n\\nHere is a timeline of Bouteflika\\'s two decades in power.\\n\\nApril 15, 1999: With the country mired in civil war, Bouteflika, a former minister, is elected to the Algerian presidency with 73.79% of votes cast.\\n\\nBacked by the army, he was running unopposed as the candidate of the ruling National Liberation Front (FLN) after other candidates pulled out, citing fears of electoral fraud.\\n\\nSeptember 16, 1999: Bouteflika\\'s Civil Concord Law is overwhelmingly approved in a referendum, leading to a sharp decline in violence. It includes an amnesty for Islamist fighters who were not involved in \"mass killings and rapes\" and who agree to submit to the authority of the state.\\n\\nThe criteria for amnesty are broadened in a later law, approved by referendum in 2005. Some 15,000 Islamist fighters are thought to have laid down their weapons since 1999.\\n\\nMarch 2002: The president says Tamazight, the Berber language, will be recognized as an official language, a year after a brutal crackdown on protesters in the Berber heartland of Kabylie kills at least 50 people.\\n\\nIt will take parliament another 14 years to sanction the Berber language\\'s official status.\\n\\nJune 2002: The FLN wins parliamentary elections marred by violence, low turnout and accusations of fraud. Throughout Bouteflika\\'s presidency, similar accusations will tarnish subsequent legislative elections, all of them won by the ruling party and its allies.\\n\\nApril 2004: Bouteflika is reelected for a second term in a landslide poll win.\\n\\nApril 11, 2007: Thirty-three people are killed in two bomb blasts in the capital, Algiers, one of them targeting the government\\'s headquarters. The attacks are claimed by al Qaeda\\'s recently rebranded North African branch, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI).\\n\\nSeptember 6, 2007: The president\\'s motorcade is targeted in a suicide attack claimed by AQMI. Three months later, the terrorist group also claims responsibility for bombs targeting the Constitutional Council and United Nations offices in Algiers.\\n\\nNovember 2008: Algeria\\'s parliament approves constitutional changes removing the two-term limit for the presidency. Five months later, Bouteflika is reelected for a third term with 90.24% of the vote.\\n\\nJanuary 2011: Protests over unemployment and the high cost of living break out in the wake of a popular uprising in neighbouring Tunisia. Government steps to cut the price of basic foodstuffs are deemed insufficient by the opposition.\\n\\nFebruary 2011: Bouteflika lifts a two-decade-old state of emergency, meeting a key demand of protesters. While protests drag on until the end of 2012, Algeria avoids the large-scale upheaval witnessed elsewhere during the Arab Spring uprisings.\\n\\nDecember 2012: During a visit to Algiers, then-French President François Hollande acknowledges the suffering caused by France\\'s \"unjust and brutal\" colonisation of Algeria, though he stops short of an apology.\\n\\nJanuary 2013: Dozens of foreign workers are taken hostage at the remote In Amenas gas plant by members of Islamist group al-Murabitoun. Algerian special forces storm the site after a four-day siege that leaves 40 workers and 29 militants dead.\\n\\nApril 2013: Bouteflika suffers a stroke that leaves him wheelchair-bound and severely diminished. He spends three months in France receiving treatment.\\n\\nMay 2014: The ailing president secures a fourth term with another landslide win, despite taking no part in the campaign. The opposition says his election is deeply flawed.\\n\\nJanuary 2016: Having all but vanished from the public eye, Bouteflika tightens his grip on power by dissolving the powerful DRS security agency, widely regarded as a \"state within the state\". The army-run body is replaced with an agency controlled by the presidency.\\n\\nMonths earlier, Bouteflika sacked Mohamed Mediène, the head of DRS for 25 years.\\n\\nAugust 2017: Prime Minister Abdelmadjid Tebboune is fired just three months after his appointment amid bitter infighting in the president\\'s entourage. His replacement is Bouteflika\\'s chief of staff, Ahmed Ouyahia.\\n\\nFebruary 10, 2019: Ending months of speculation, Bouteflika confirms he will seek a fifth mandate in a presidential election on April 18, state media announce.\\n\\nFebruary 22: Anger at the president\\'s attempts to cling on to power boils over as tens of thousands of people demonstrate in several cities including Algiers, where protests have been banned since 2001.\\n\\nMarch 1: After a string of smaller protests, huge crowds rally again in Algiers and elsewhere in the country to voice their anger at the president\\'s re-election bid. Riot police fire tear gas to disperse the protesters.\\n\\nMarch 3: State television reads out a letter from Bouteflika, now aged 82, vowing that he will not serve a full term if re-elected and will let a national conference set a date for early polls in which he will not participate.\\n\\nWith the president believed to be in Switzerland for medical treatment, his campaign manager formally submits his candidacy.',\n",

Due to these demonstrations, on February 14, 2019, the Department of State ordered the departure of all non-emergency US personnel and their family members,\" it said in a statement.\\n\\nCanada also said it was closing its embassy in Port-au-Prince on Thursday due to \"current volatility,\" but would \"continue to assess the situation in the coming days.\"\\n\\nMoise, a 50-year-old former entrepreneur who set up a string of businesses in the north of the country, where he hails from, burst on to the political stage two years ago with a populist message of building up the impoverished Caribbean nation.\\n\\nPopulist pledges\\n\\nHis talk was backed up by his business background: past ventures included water treatment, the energy sector and agricultural production, the latter of which earned him his nickname, \"Neg Bannan nan\" or \"The Banana Man\" in Creole.\\n\\nHis business interests led him to a meeting in 2014 with the man who would become his political mentor, then- president Michel Martelly, a former singer who had once performed under the stage name Sweet Micky.

       "    'body': 'Haitians took to the streets of the capital Port-au-Prince\\'s once again on Wednesday to demand the resignation of the country\\'s President Jovenel Moïse as tensions continue to mount after a week of demonstrations marked by violent clashes with the police.\\n\\nAccording to AFP, a young man died at a crossroads near the presidential palace in Port-au-Prince and a Haitian journalist was wounded by gunshots during crossfire between police and protestors.\\n\\nThe former French colony has been mired in a political crisis since February 7 that has left at least seven people dead and everyday life in the largest towns paralyzed by protests and barricades.\\n\\nDemonstrators, who come mostly from poor neighbourhoods, are demanding Moïse\\'s resignation over graft scandals and for failing to tackle widespread poverty.\\n\\n\"This government is seen as incapable of tackling the economic crisis or the corruption,\" said Jake Johnston, researcher at the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) and author of its Haiti: Relief and Reconstruction Watch blog.\\n\\n\"It\\'s a popular uprising. Haitians are occupying the streets to make it clear that Jovenel (Moïse) has no choice but to resign,\" said demonstrator Prophete Hilaire, who was marching across the capital. \"A government that cannot give its people nourishment and water must step down,\" he added.\\n\\nCrippling crisis\\n\\nHaiti is the poorest country in the Americas and one of the poorest in the world, with three-fifths of the nearly 11 million population living below the national poverty line of $2 a day. According to a United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs report in July 2018, some 1.3 million Haitians depend on food assistance.\\n\\nEach year, thousands of young people flee as illegal migrants, including to nearby Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands.\\n\\n\"Since 2016, the country has faced a two-digit inflation, the national currency lost half of its value over the course of the last four years. And half of this decline actually happened last year,\" Johnston said.\\n\\nMisappropriated development funds\\n\\nThe current demonstrations kicked off when Moïse found himself at the heart of a corruption scandal over the Petrocaribe fund, under which Venezuela supplied Haiti and other Caribbean and Central American countries with oil for years at cut-rate prices and easy credit terms.\\n\\nInvestigations have shown that nearly $2 billion intended for development projects were misused from the program. In January, a report on the case revealed that a company, then headed by Moïse, was a beneficiary of funds from a road construction project. The company never a signed contract, according to the report.\\n\\nLegitimacy crisis\\n\\nMoïse is not the only Haitian leader to have seen his legitimacy disputed.\\n\\nAccording to Johnston, \"there is a crisis of legitimacy concerning Haitians politicians who weren\\'t able to respond to the population\\'s needs\". Moïse\\'s case is even worse.\\n\\nHaiti\\'s current president only came into power in 2017 after a second poll, the first one having been cancelled over reports of massive fraud. \"When the second election took place, less than 20 percent of the voters showed up. Even though no irregularities were found during the second ballot, such turnout rate could never lead to a stable term,\" Johnston added.\\n\\nAlthough many protestors have been killed in the current turmoil, Moïse and his prime minister have remained dead silent. Neither has reacted to the latest events, despite the violence sometimes breaking out only a few metres from the presidential palace.\\n\\nFRANCE 24\\'s Amélie Baron reported from Port-au-Prince that \"no solution has been put forward for now. But the authorities will have to take decisions, because the anger of the people is only growing\".\\n\\nA crisis destined to last\\n\\n\"Ignoring once again the people\\'s legitimate demands is a guarantee that the crisis will last a long time,\" Johnston agreed.\\n\\n\"Authorities seem to blame the turmoil on a political opposition willing to seize power. They presume that it will run short of money and the movement will then cool down and the country will be calm again.\"\\n\\nAuthorities are also counting on October 2019\\'s legislative elections to ease the tension. But \"it would be very naive to think that these elections alone can solve this crisis,\" said Johnston.\\n\\nEven a political dialogue with the opposition might not help, for \"there is not even one credible leader who is in position to control the demonstrators by himself\", Johnston noted, adding that there will only be progressive talks when \"civil society\" takes its place at the negotiating table.',\n",

       "    'body': 'All 78 detainees at the prison in Aquin, a city of around 100,000 on the south coast of the country\\'s Tiburon Peninsula, escaped around midday, a national police spokesman said.\\n\\nThe exact circumstances of the prison break are unclear, but witnesses said it took place during an anti-Moise demonstration in front of the police station adjoining the penitentiary.\\n\\nSome 200 kilometers (120 miles) north of the prison, Port-au-Prince also saw clashes between police and hundreds of protesters in working-class neighborhoods.\\n\\nThousands of people took to the streets. After police forces dispersed them, some set fire to cars and looted stores to express their mounting frustrations over growing social inequalities worsened by systemic corruption.\\n\\nA youth was also shot dead at a crossroads near the presidential palace.\\n\\nThe former French colony is in the grip of a political crisis that has seen citizens demonstrate in the capital Port-au-Prince and elsewhere over the last week to demand Moise\\'s resignation.\\n\\nBarricades have sprung up in some areas of the capital and other cities, with protesters demanding the president answer reports of mismanagement and possible embezzlement of development funds in the impoverished Caribbean nation.\\n\\nPolice only provided a toll after the first day of nationwide protests on February 7, with two killed on the sidelines of the marches. Since then, AFP has counted four other people shot dead.\\n\\nAmid the degradation in security conditions, the US State Department ordered all minor children of diplomats posted at the American embassy in Haiti to leave the country.\\n\\nIn a statement, the agency also \"approved the authorized departure of adult family members and non-emergency US personnel.\"\\n\\nPrison conditions in Haiti are considered to be among the most inhumane in the world by human rights groups. Detainees face extremely crowded conditions, poor hygiene, food shortages and a lack of health care.\\n\\nThe justice system is notoriously slow and has been blamed for contributing to the crisis.\\n\\nIn October, an investigation found that three quarters of the 11,839 people imprisoned in Haiti were still waiting for a court ruling -- a delay that has sometimes stretched beyond a decade.\\n\\n\\'President lied to us\\'\\n\\nDemonstrators are demanding Moise quit over a scandal centering on the Petrocaribe fund, under which Venezuela supplied Haiti and other Caribbean and Central American countries with oil at cut-rate prices and on easy credit terms for years.\\n\\n\"The president lied to us. These promises of giving us work so we can finally have money to buy food was just bluffing,\" said Vanel Louis-Paul, who joined protesters demanding change.\\n\\n\"Look, he\\'s been in power for two years and people are starving now more than ever. If Jovenel won\\'t go, we will make the bourgeoisie that supported him suffer so it understands.\"\\n\\nAdding to the mounting frustration, investigations have shown that nearly $2 billion from the program were misused.\\n\\nA report released in January on the misuse of the money also named a company that was then headed by Moise as a beneficiary of funds from a road construction project that never had a signed contract.\\n\\nDuring his election campaign, Moise promised \"food on every plate and money in every pocket,\" yet most Haitians still struggle to make ends meet and face inflation that has risen 15 percent since his election.\\n\\nA mediation group composed of a senior officials from the UN, Brazil and a coalition of Western nations has called on Haiti\\'s politicians to enter dialogue over the crisis, lamenting the loss of life and damage caused by the protests.\\n\\nWhile the government has offered no response to the demands of demonstrators, opposition groups have also failed to spell out any concrete solution to the crisis, beyond calling for the president to step aside.',\n",

       "    'title': 'Yellow Vests struggle to define their movement as protest turnout falls ',\n",
       "    'body': 'The protests - which began in response to the government\\'s decision to introduce annual increases to diesel and carbon taxes - has since coalesced into a broader opposition against French President Emmanuel Macron\\'s government, the high cost of living in France and widespread economic uncertainty.\\n\\nBut a movement that has attracted many who are experiencing economic anxiety has struggled to transform popular anger into a real political force. The Yellow Vests have failed to anoint leaders who can take them forward nor agreed on clearly defined goals.\\n\\nPriscillia Ludosky and Éric Drouet emerged as early leaders of the movement after creating an \"official\" Yellow Vest Facebook page calling for the first nationwide protests on November 17 in response to the government\\'s decision to raise a direct tax on diesel fuel.\\n\\nThe idea to create the page came from a popular petition Ludosky posted online earlier in the year demanding Macron repeal the tax. Following the success of the first two Yellow Vest protests, Ludosky and Drouet were among eight representatives of the movement invited to attend a meeting on November 27 with Environment Minister François de Rugy. In the end, they were the only two to accept the invitation.\\n\\nBut the pair soon had a falling out. In the month that followed, Drouet took an increasingly hard line, even calling on protesters to storm the Élysée presidential palace. He was arrested in December after organising an unauthorised protest in Paris.\\n\\nIn January, Ludosky published a statement announcing that she would no longer be working with Drouet, who she accused of \"harming\" the movement.\\n\\n\"We decided to go our separate ways,\" Drouet later said in a video posted online. \"We can\\'t always be in agreement on what to do, and how to do it.\"\\n\\nEnter Maxime Nicolle, another Yellow Vest protester whose online videos have attracted thousands of followers. The 31-year-old, who also goes by the alias Fly Rider, rose to national prominence after appearing as a guest on several popular French television shows. He made a bid to become the movement\\'s official spokesman in early December.\\n\\n\"I would not decide anything, I would just give voice to what you decide,\" Nicolle told Yellow Vests supporters on Facebook Live.\\n\\nOne of the movement\\'s most divisive figures, however, is arguably Jacline Mouraud, 51, who rose to fame after a video she posted online lambasting Macron\\'s government drew more than 5 million views. Since then, she has come under fire from Yellow Vest protesters for using the movement as a platform to launch her own political party. She hopes to make headway in the country\\'s municipal elections in 2020.\\n\\n\"She\\'s hit rock bottom!\" Drouet said of Mouraud\\'s political ambitions in late December.\\n\\nDisparate demands\\n\\nWithout a leader, the movement has also been unable to clearly define its demands. Disparate voices have emerged, making it difficult to understand what, exactly, most Yellow Vest protesters want.\\n\\nIn a four-page open letter posted in January on the \"official\" Yellow Vest Facebook page co-founded by Ludosky and Drouet, members of the movement listed a number of demands, including direct talks with the government, lower taxes and social charges, and the introduction of a citizens\\' initiative referendum.\\n\\n>> Read more: \\'Yellow Vests\\' open a new front in the battle: Popular referendums\\n\\nBut Drouet and Nicolle have taken a tougher stance, demanding Macron\\'s resignation.\\n\\nMouraud, meanwhile, has called for a \"major overhaul\" of the French constitution, including an amendment guaranteeing men and women equal pay. She also proposed combining the roles of president and prime minister.\\n\\n\"There\\'s one person too many at the head of the executive branch,\" she told AFP in a statement. \"This duality can be a source of conflict, even instability.\"\\n\\nOther figures have sought to shape the movement\\'s message through the upcoming European parliamentary elections. Ingrid Levavasseur, 31, announced in late January that she intends to lead a list of Yellow Vest candidates in the May vote.\\n\\n\"The European elections are the first opportunity we\\'ve been presented with, so here we go,\" she said in an interview published this month in French daily Le Figaro, adding that France \"needs Europe, the European Union\".\\n\\nSince then there have been other French media reports of several potential Yellow Vest candidates, each with a different platform.\\n\\nThe discord has left the movement with little bargaining power. A first meeting in November between Prime Minister Édouard Philippe and a delegation of eight Yellow Vest protesters ended in fiasco, after all but one member of the movement walked out following a disagreement over whether the exchange could be filmed.\\n\\nAnother attempt to organise talks in December also collapsed.\\n\\n\"No one is in agreement. I spent my afternoon calling people. The organisation is a mess,\" Nicolle said at the time.\\n\\nNew divisions arose within the movement when Macron announced a string of concessions in December, including raising the minimum wage and launching a \"grand national debate\" on government policy. Although many Yellow Vest protesters have dismissed the town hall-style meetings he called for as a political ploy, Macron\\'s approval ratings have inched upward since the first debate was held on January 15.\\n\\nAnd yet the Yellow Vests still enjoy broad public support in France, with 58 percent of respondents in an Ifop poll published on February 4 saying they had a positive opinion of the movement.',\n",

      "Investigations have shown that nearly $2 billion intended for development projects were misused from the program.
